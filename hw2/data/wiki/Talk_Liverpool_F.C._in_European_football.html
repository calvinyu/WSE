<p>I've read this a couple of times now and before I even go into the specific GA criteria, I am placing the review on hold for two weeks to give editors time to address various concerns I have at present (there may well be more to come). I have several initial comments to make and I am proposing a rewrite of the lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>1. I'm not sure if anything can be done about this but I would prefer the title to be <i>Liverpool Football Club in Europe</i> because I see "F.C." as an unnecessary abbreviation that may not be clear to all readers.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I disagree with this, the main article about the club is <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> with the abbreviation intact. Why should this page be named differently? I think there have been discussions before about this at <a href="Wikipedia_FOOTY" title="Wikipedia:FOOTY" class="mw-redirect">WP:FOOTY</a> before, so it is probably best to look through them for guidance on the issue. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:35, 10 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>2. The club and the team are singular entities and should be denoted by "it" and "its", not the plural "they" and "their". This should be fixed throughout. The frequent use of "the club" is a distraction and should mostly be replaced by "Liverpool", subject to context.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm sure there is convention at WP:FOOTY to choose "they" a number of featured articles such as <a href="Ipswich_Town_F.C." title="Ipswich Town F.C.">Ipswich Town F.C.</a>, <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United F.C.</a> and <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal F.C.</a> so I would bring the issue there because if these are articles are featured and use that convention. Plus those articles also use "the club" frequently, I also do not understand why it's a distraction. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:35, 10 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>3. I'm proposing a new version of the lead below but one thing that stands out here and elsewhere in the article is a need to clarify the current status of the Premier League <i>vis-à-vis</i> the former Football League Division One. The article tends to give a misleading impression about the Premier League when half of Liverpool's European qualifications were by virtue of their success in the old First Division.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>done <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 17:55, 26 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>4. "Milan" is called "A.C. Milan" and should be referenced as such throughout. Similar examples are Ajax Amsterdam, Deportivo Alavés, Olympique Lyonnais, Olympique de Marseille and so on: I'm finding too much colloquial rendering of team names.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Again we do not refer to clubs by there full name but by there most common name see <a href="Wikipedia_COMMONNAME" title="Wikipedia:COMMONNAME" class="mw-redirect">WP:COMMONNAME</a>. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:35, 10 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>5. Remove all references to the Intercontinental Cup and its successor as that is out of scope: the article is about European football.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>I'm not sure about this. Granted it is not technically European competition but entry is gained through winning a European competition so on that basis I think it comes under the scope. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:35, 10 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>6. It is not clear if Carragher's appearance record is Liverpool-based or if he is the English or even European record holder; and, as he is a current player, this needs to be made clear. Similarly, the statement about Gerrard's scoring record needs to note that he is a current player. At what date did the two statistics apply?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>7. Re Gerrard, the sentence "The most goals scored in European competition by a Liverpool player is Steven Gerrard, with 38" is poor English. Suggested change: "Steven Gerrard with 38 goals (to May 2011) is Liverpool's record goalscorer in European competition".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>think this was the sentence in the record section, which is now bullet points <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 17:55, 26 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>8. The table in the Record by Season section doesn't provide enough information. The equivalent article about Manchester United has a table providing the results of all matches played in European competition in an easy to read and useful format. More research is needed to provide similar detail for Liverpool: the "last opposition" column says nothing to the reader and looks like an easy way out.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>With all respect that article hasn't been up for GA. To have a table of all the matches played in Europe would be unruly and more than double the size of the page. With Liverpool likely to add to their European experience I don't think this table is appropriate. I'll remove the last oppsotition column as you're not the first user to complain about it. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:35, 10 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>9. The article needs careful checking for factual errors. For example, Liverpool did not win the 1970–71 FA Cup but was the runner-up and qualified for the CWC because Arsenal had "done the double". Another one is the misinformation that Shankly "resigned" and "was replaced" by Paisley. It is more accurate to say that Shankly retired and was succeeded by Paisley.</li>
</ul>

<dd>done <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 10:15, 13 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>10. There are several examples of what looks like tabloid-speak, always a danger when writing about football, though at least the awful "grabbed a goal" cliche does not make an appearance. In effect, this is about the need to remove cliches. An example is this passage: "The club reached the semi-finals of the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup in the 1970–71 season. They faced fellow English club Leeds United, who won 1–0 on aggregate en route to winning the competition". Instead of "the club", use "Liverpool". This applies throughout as already mentioned. Remove "fellow English club" and suchlike redundant expressions. Better is: "Liverpool reached the semi-finals of the 1970–71 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup but lost 0–1 on aggregate to Leeds United".</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>11. The main narrative ends with the defeat by Atlético Madrid in 2010 which was the last match under Benitez. A new section is needed to begin with the 2010–11 season and point out the changes that have taken place at Anfield this season, albeit these did not produce immediate European success.</li>

<p>I have a lot of problems with the lead which needs to be revised. Taking the current content and without introducing any additional information, I would write the lead along these lines:</p>

<p>Over the last couple of days, I've tried to improve the wording, content and layout of the article which was nowhere near a pass for being well-written. Although some further tweaks will be needed, it is now in a much better shape (a bit like Liverpool themselves in recent months!). However, I still have concerns and am not able to pass the article yet, but I'm not going to fail it as I think it is definitely heading in the right direction. I'm continuing to keep it on hold so that more work can be done within the term of this review.</p>
<ol>
<li>As I said at the outset, I am very unhappy with the title. Okay, I am English and interested in sport, though football is not my favourite. As such, I immediately understand this article is about a football club playing European matches. But I have asked four people I know who have no interest in football to tell me what they think the title indicates and, apart from one lady who remembered that Liverpool does have a famous football team, they were confused. The initials F.C. could mean almost anything to a non-football fan and the words "in Europe" completely lack context. An American gentleman guessed that F.C. might mean "Ferry Company" given the Mersey ferry association; all of them pointed out that the C could stand for city, council, committee, etc. I know you have followed football project precedent in using this title but, although many football supporters do not realise it, the majority of people do not like football and have no knowledge of it. To them, this form of title is cryptic and misleading. My colleagues all think the title should be "Liverpool Football Club in European competition". However, this would appear to be an issue for the whole site rather than just the football project and I doubt if I would be able or willing to take it further so I'll let this go.</li>
<li>When I suggested above that the club and the team are singular entities, I was incorrect as the team is clearly a plurality so I accept the "they" and "their" in that context, but any references to the club must be treated as singular. I think we have resolved this now via all the copyediting.</li>
<li>Re points 3 to 12 raised above, I'm happy with the responses provided and the actions taken so those are all now closed.</li>
<li>This is the first of the new points. The main reason I am keeping the article on hold is because of the coverage. The article is essentially statistical in spirit with a focus on which competition Liverpool played in each season, having done such and such in the previous English season, and how far they got before winning or being eliminated. There is nothing about tactics and nothing, except goalscoring, about the key players. Several key players such as Callaghan, Clemence, Heighway, Hansen and Alonso are not mentioned at all. The article needs to discuss the strategies and tactics used by the major managers in European matches: comparing their approach to a home leg with that to an away leg; European tactics versus league tactics; evolution of tactics from Shankly to Benitez, etc. The reader needs to know why Kevin Keegan, for example, was such a significant player for Liverpool in European matches and how Shankly and Paisley made use of him. <b>At present, the article fails the broad in coverage requirement</b>.</li>
<li>One further suggestion I have re the scope is around Liverpool's transfer activity in the European market. This began with Keegan's move to Hamburg and then there was a gradual influx of players like Molby, Henchoz and Hyppia from the continent before it escalated under Houllier and Benitez. Benitez in particular wished to improve Liverpool's chances of European success by introducing a largely Spanish contingent including Reina, Alonso, Torres. All of this is relevant to the club's strategy in European football and needs to be discussed. --<a href="User_Mykleavens" title="User:Mykleavens">Mykleavens</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mykleavens" title="User talk:Mykleavens">talk</a>) 13:57, 30 May 2011 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Personally I don't think this is related to this article. I think they were bought simply to improve the team domestically and in European football, I'll try and mention signings where necessary Keegan and Dalglish I think are necessary due to debate Keegan being replaced other tan this I'm not sure they would fit in. I'll see what I can fit in though. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 17:23, 2 June 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The Shankly section does not mention one single Liverpool player but it does name a referee and one opponent. Major Liverpool players under Shankly were St John, Hunt, Yeats, Callaghan, Smith, Hughes, Clemence, Heighway, Keegan, Toshack, etc. The 1973 UEFA Cup win, a milestone in the club's history, is dismissed in a few words.</li>

<li>The season summary table links are unsatisfactory and need to be overhauled. The season column links to both English seasons and Liverpool seasons while the competition season link is under the right-hand column for the round. Also, there is no need to link any of the competition names as this amounts to repetition. Please unlink everything in the competition and round columns and use the specific tournament link for each season. --<a href="User_Mykleavens" title="User:Mykleavens">Mykleavens</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mykleavens" title="User talk:Mykleavens">talk</a>) 22:01, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</li>

<li>Although the 2005 final was a great match, I think recentism is evident given the emphasis placed on it. The 1977 final was the key Liverpool triumph in Europe as it opened the floodgates at a time when Liverpool were not the competition favourites they subsequently became. A balance is needed when referring to individual events so my concern is about undue weight.</li>
<li>I cannot see anything that suggests original research or point of view (apart from perhaps the recentism concern) so it is objective and passes that requirement.</li>
<li>I am reasonably happy with the citations except that more may well be called for and I have already added a few citation requests here and there. Given that additional work is needed to broaden the coverage, I haven't reviewed the existing citations in detail as yet but, in general, they are plentiful and varied. I would, however, like to see more use of the books in the bibliography and less of the internet.</li>
<li>I have no problem with neutrality. The article is stable and is well supplied with images that cannot have any copyright problems. It easily passes all three of these criteria.</li>
<li>Subject to the way the additional material is incorporated, the article would currently pass the well-written requirement although it has needed a lot of copyedit work to bring it up to standard and, as mentioned above, more may be necessary. I will expect the standard to be maintained as the coverage increases.</li>
</ol>
<p>To summarise, the article remains <b>on hold for one month</b> pending additional information to broaden its coverage. I'll update the GA nominations page accordingly and will keep looking at the article to help where I can. --<a href="User_Mykleavens" title="User:Mykleavens">Mykleavens</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mykleavens" title="User talk:Mykleavens">talk</a>) 12:15, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</p>

<p>Yes sure, apologies if I jumped the gun. I do think however that the changes I made addressed a lot of issues, mainly to do with repetition and excessive detail in the lead. The UEFA Cup photo semed to work well too.

<p>I've just noticed that the suggested lead given by the reviewer above DOES NOT correspond to what is currently in the article. I would go with installing the reviewer's, which similarly deals with a lot of the repetition problems as my rewrite, but I would cut the last sentence as it is stats that is repeated in the stats-like appendix at the end. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 13:03, 14 May 2011 (UTC)</p>

I believe that in order for the rest of the article to get up to GA status, it needs to be copy edited and reworked as boldly as this—to cut out the numerous examples of language that are non-encyclopaedic; to reduce the bloated feel of much of the language; and to deal with examples of repetition. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 09:42, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I disagree the lead that the reviewer suggested was fine seeing as he is reviewing the article and has done a great job so far his lead should be used. Plus the way you have used the images makes the lead look awful in my opinion. On this basis I'm going to revert back to the reviewer's lead as it is more comprehensive than yours. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 14:28, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>The lead that the reviewer suggested was a massive improvement on what was there before, but it was a provisional first stab. What I and he then did was to improve it further—it still contained repetition and too much detail for the lead. The fact that the reviewer made further cuts to my reduced lead would I have thought been a tacit acknowledgement from the reviewer that the changes I made were a move in the right direction. The addition of the image of the UEFA cup was also a clear improvement (though I'm beginning to have doubts about where it should go exactly, maybe next to the description of their win in Dortmund. I'm therefore going to revert it back, putting the cups (for the time being) 100px size and both on the right <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 16:27, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The image was not an improvement it made the lead look clunky and awful. It's not repetition, the lead is supposed to summarise the whole article see <a href="Wikipedia_LEAD" title="Wikipedia:LEAD" class="mw-redirect">WP:LEAD</a>. Therefore it should include aspects of all sections, by this notion if a para about the records is not included then it fails this criteria. Plus there should not be a one sentence paragraph in the lead. The lead is supposed to summarise the article not introduce it at the moment it just introduces it that's way I think the reviewer's lead was much better as it conforms to the MOS on leads. Your edits were in violation of some of the MOS see <a href="Wikipedia_MOS#IMAGES" title="Wikipedia:MOS" class="mw-redirect">WP:MOS#IMAGES</a> and <a href="Wikipedia_Manual_of_Style_(layout)#Images" title="Wikipedia:Manual of Style (layout)" class="mw-redirect">Wikipedia:Manual_of_Style_(layout)#Images</a>. Images should not be stacked and the two images now in use are too small to be seen. It was better with the one image in the lead and one in the main text. I'm not going to revert the lead back as it will just result in an edit war, I'm going to message the GA reviewer to get his opinion as at the moment with reverting and re-reverting the article is never going to get to GA. Hopefully the three of us can reach a consensus in this regard. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 16:58, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I thought the changes introduced to the lead by Jprw earlier today might have consensus so I confined myself to removing repetition and general copyediting. I think there should be only one image in the lead section so I would prefer to put the UEFA Cup photo in the main text where it is appropriate and can easily fit: best place is next to the 2001 win (I would prefer the 1973 win but that will cause stacking).</dd>
<dd>NapHit is right that the lead must summarise the whole article and, in my view, should outline the scope. Therefore, I think it should include mention of the main records and, given that the structure is based on management terms, it should also say something about those managers who won trophies. I've been working on it again to try and combine the best aspects of both your versions but I would point out that more content will be necessary because the article should be expanded to improve its coverage, per the latest review. --<a href="User_Mykleavens" title="User:Mykleavens">Mykleavens</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mykleavens" title="User talk:Mykleavens">talk</a>) 20:56, 28 May 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Thanks to you both, I agree that it's all about striking a balance now and I apologise if I went too far in my edit. I now look forward to trying to optimise the lead according to WP:LEAD, and, of course, with a view to achiving GA.

<dd>We can't mention all of the games in the run up to the final, the article would be too long, and as there were no notable matches in the run up to the 1984 final there is no need to include them. Quite frankly, the bit about Ian Rush is most definitely not needed so what if he considered it the most brutal game of his career, that has no relevance in article about Liverpool in Europe. Why not include what Thompson, Hughes, Yeats etc through was their most brutal game or favourite game, why Rush? That sort of info belongs in the player's article not this one. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 18:48, 1 September 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>"There were no notable matches in the run up to the 1984 final"</p>
<p>This is simply not true. The Benfica and Bucharest games, at least, deserve a mention. Also, the games leading up to other European finals are documented in the article; hence by not including the 84 run up games the article is inconsistent. You may be right about the inadvisability of singling out the Rush quote, although both Hansen and Dalglish mention the ferocity of the tie in their bios so maybe a general description is warranted. I’m also wondering if <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/the-tie-that-turned-fergie-into-anfields-worst-enemy-2233544.html">this</a> could be included somewhere, it looks like a great ref.</p>

<dd>Fair enough I'll have a look at my books and try and pick out some notable tidbits about the run-up, I'm fairly sure there was an infamous incident with Souness who broke one of the Bucharest's players jaw, which could be included.

<dd>I'm afraid the way you rearranged the photos is against policy, you can't stack photos. The photo of the trophy in the museum is fine in the lead, its more relevant to the article than the other one. Please stop removing the European competition section, this was requested in the recent Peer review by an experienced editor. It is for people who are unaware of all the different competitions UEFA has had. The goal is to get the article to FA, this section will be needed, as many people that read the article will not follow football, and will be baffled by all the competitions. This section helps them understand the different competitions. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:21, 17 September 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>The article is going backwards: the section outlining all the competitions is lengthy and inappropriate. A see also section with the appropriate link gets round the problem perfectly; a footnote may be another solution. The image in the lead is terrible -- out of focus, not even centred. The best possible image of the trophy should be in the lead and your image relegated later on to, say, the Istanbul section until a better image of the Istanbul trophy is found. These are logical and sensible suggestions. You seem to think that you <a class="external text" href="Wikipedia_Own">own</a> the article and resist / immediately undo the helpful edits of other editors for taking the article forward. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 15:37, 17 September 2011 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Personally, I believe that you think you own the article considering your edits. I keep telling you that the competitions section was recommended at the recent <a href="Wikipedia_Peer_review/Liverpool_F.C._in_Europe/archive2/index.html" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Liverpool F.C. in Europe/archive2">PR</a>, because you obviously haven't read it. If a respected editor such as Ruhrfisch suggests the section is needed then it should be implemented. A see also does not solve the problem perfectly, the problem is still there. The problem being that readers unaware of European football will be confused by the different competitions. Therefore, a section outlining them is necessary, a see also section means they have to trawl through another page to find the information when it can be provided briefly at the start. Its not my image by the way, its a random one from flickr, but its more relevant to the article that's why it should be in the lead, as it is the trophy they won permanently, as opposed to a random one. Plus moving it to the relevant section doesn't solve anything as then there are three images of the trophy in the article, when others should be used. The article is not going backwards at all, I have experience getting articles to FA standard and this article is heading there. I don't what to start mud-slinging but to say I am stopping editors from taking the article forward is not the case. If an edit improves the article I'm gine with that, but removing a section tat was requested in a peer review is not taking the article forward, so perhaps you should take a look at yourself before accusing others first. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:50, 17 September 2011 (UTC)

<dd>Out of interest how is the article unbalanced? As regards needing to be rewritten, I've recently requested a copyedit with regards to FAC so once that is done it should be fine.

<p>2) Re: the lengthy detour to describe the history of UEFA footballing comps, it just to me looks bizarre and wrong. That is surely why we have things like internal refs, "See also" sections, and footnotes. An opinion from another editor is perhaps needed.</p>
<dl>
<dd>It is definitely needed the more I think about it. For me and you who know about the intricacies of European football its not necessary, but for the casual reader with no knowledge it is needed as they won't understand the competitions. See also sections are in my opinion a waste of time. As the topic is about European competition it makes sense to explain the different European competitions to the reader as its relevant to the article. Especially since some of them, have changed their name recently. Getting the opinion of other reviewers is what peer reviews are for, and seeing as it was suggested I'm going to put it back in. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 17:35, 18 September 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>4) Re: ownership, you have undone on a number of occasions work I have done to improve the text / wording with no discussion or (usually) for very flimsy reasons. If I was in your position, I would welcome another editor wanting to take the article forward; you do seem to see this as a "solo project" and input from other editors as akin to "interference". At the same time, the enormous amount of work that you have put into the article is of course commendable. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 05:34, 18 September 2011 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Well you've undone work I've done, with regards to the European competition, so I think we're both to blame here. I'll admit I have not been very co-operative, but that's because I don't have experience working with another editor improving an article, I tend to do them by myself. Obviously, we both want the article to improve and get to FA, so I think we need to find a way to work together to achieve this. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 17:35, 18 September 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Great, clearly a spirit of cooperation is the best way to take the article forward. At the moment I'm concerned about the extended description of the Torres signing; it seems to smack of recentism, as well as being somewhat off-topic. Re: the images, why don't we experiment with a few options before deciding on the best layout. I didn't realize about the multiple-winner badge being non-free use, sorry about that. Let's also get some input from another editor re: the extended background description of the Euro comps, it still to me looks decidedly odd. Also, isn’t it repetitious of information already included in the lead? <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 14:02, 19 September 2011 (UTC)</p>
<p>Another (slight) criticism I have is that the Ponting book is overused.

<dl>
<dd>Yep, I agree. Hmm, I see your point, but the GA reviewer said he wanted to see info like this in the article, although to be fair Benitez did moan a lot about money to buy players after losing the final, so in that regard its relevant. Ye experimenting with options is good for me, just make sure the images are free use otherwise when the article goes to FA, we'll be pulled up on this. I agree the opinion of another editor would help, ideally one who is not familiar with football, to see if the section serves its intended purpose. Regarding the lead, the job of the lead is to summarise the content of the article, so in that regard it is fine. But another opinion would help. Well, seeing as the book has the same name as the article I was bound to use it more than the other books I have, but I'll try and use a few more of my other books for refs. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 15:05, 19 September 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>During the copyedit a few things came to light that <i>may</i> need attention:</p>
<dl>
<dt>Return to Europe (1991–2004)</dt>
</dl>
<p>(Paragraph 4)</p>
<ul>
<li>"Having finished fourth in the <a href="1999%E2%80%932000_FA_Premier_League" title="1999–2000 FA Premier League">1999–2000 FA Premier League</a>, Liverpool qualified for the <a href="2000%E2%80%9301_UEFA_Cup" title="2000–01 UEFA Cup">2000–01 UEFA Cup</a> and won the competition for a record-equalling third time. The season was the club's most successful since the 1980s as, domestically, Liverpool won both the FA Cup and the League Cup to claim a cup treble." - the sentences implies that the treble was domestic (maybe also link to [[Treble (association football)]]?). Perhaps reword to "The season was the club's most successful since the 1980s as Liverpool won a cup treble with the UEFA Cup, the FA Cup and the League Cup." There is also the last sentence, where it tells of Liverpool wining the Cup winners' cup - surely this is a quadruple? Alternatively the words "Continental treble" could be used?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Benítez years (2004–10)</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>(para 2) "Trailing 3–0 at half-time, ..." The para graph starts without saying which match this is in. If it refers to the last sentence of the previous para (AC Milan) then they need tying together.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>General</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Scores - sometimes the scores are written 0-1 and others are 1-0. I do not know what the recommended way of writing them is, but it did not make sense to have them in contradicting styles. One Liverpool loss was written "Liverpool blah blah beaten by Another club 0-1" while others followed the narrative "Liverpool blah blah lost Another club 1-0". I would suggest writing them either all from the perspective of Liverpool, where Liverpool's score is always the left-hand one, or following the narrative, where the first mentioned team is the left-hand score.</li>

<p>The Winter quote looks like an excellent addition to capture the historic nature of the match, yet it has been removed twice. It is difficult to understand this, especially given that less important descriptions such as <i>The performance of Gary McAllister, whose free-kick resulted in the winning goal, was praised as "outstanding" by Trevor Brooking.</i> seem to be allowed. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 07:19, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>The difference between the two is that the quote about McAllister is not POV as he was the man of the match in the final, whereas this is Winter's own personal opinion, what makes his opinion so important above others? Its not encyclopaedic neither is the inclusion of the ref which refers to the match as the miracle of Istanbul, the article is supposed to have a neutral tone, inclusion of stuff like this does give a neutral tone. Also why did you remove the bit about the 2005 FIFA Club World Cup, this is relevant as Liverpool qualify for the competition through the Champions League and are Europe's representatives in the competition so by that token it is relevant, it would help if you discussed these things before jumping in carte blanche and making changes, ignoring the fact that there is an ongoing peer review which is aiming to improve the article. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 11:06, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</dd>
</dl>
<p>There seem to be three main points that need to be addressed:</p>
<ul>
<li>The problem is that as it stands the very dry and matter-of-fact description of the 2005 final (it didn't even have an internal ref to the WP article on it, by the way) doesn't convey that this was, undoubtedly, the most extraordinary event in Liverpool's participation in European competition (if not the club's history), as well as being one of the truly extraordinary European nights. There is nothing wrong with trying to give the reader a taste of that by using e.g. the Winter quote (which is one of many that can be found in the literature, though I opted to use his because he may well be the most pre-eminent football writer covering the sport in the UK today), or referring to the event as the "miracle of Istanbul" (which the game is commonly called by all manner of media). I don't think this would compromise "neutrality" at all, but rather would give the reader more insight into the event.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I agree it was an extrordinary match, but wikipedia is an encyclopedia it has to maintain neutrality, and your claim that it is "the most extraordinary event in Liverpool's participation in European competition (if not the club's history)" is your opinion it can't be claimed as fact as other people will view other finals as more important, the 1977 or 1984 finals for instance its a matter of opinion not fact. Thinking about I think there is a way to get the refs in the article without it sounding too POV, and we have to remember not to focus too much on this one match, as its undue weight, I'll include them now and you tell me what you think. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 12:28, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes and I explained why that final is relevant above they are representing Europe in that competition, they qualified for it through European competition, it is relevant, editors asked for this to be included at the recent FAC, so I think consensus incurs that it should be included. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 12:28, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</dd>

<p>1) I don't think there can really be any doubt that the 2005 final, as well as being the final that earned them the right to keep the trophy, eclipses all other Euro finals that Liverpool competed in (there are numerous statements by players past and present to support this, as well as countless media references, etc.) <b>The article must therefore in some way try to reflect this</b>. I fully understand the point about weight, that's why I think it would be a good idea to try and find the juiciest quote by a very high-profile football commentator. 2) A clear compromise would be to state that by winning x they qualified to play in y and then leave it at that. No details of match y need to be given if it falls outside the purview of UEFA competitions. 3) I'm glad that we're making some progress on content. I have to say though that I'm having trouble understanding the rationale of other editors' wanting to include details about a match that should clearly be outside the scope of this article. I suggest a wording along the lines of "which meant that they qualified for the <a href="2005_FIFA_Club_World_Championship" title="2005 FIFA Club World Championship">2005 FIFA Club World Championship</a>" and then editors can click on the internal ref if they want to know more. <a href="User_Jprw" title="User:Jprw">Jprw</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jprw" title="User talk:Jprw">talk</a>) 13:49, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>I've trimmed the bit about the 2005 FIFA Club World Championship right down its just two short sentences stating that were entitled to play in it and lost the competition, should be enough. Regarding the quote, the problem I have it is trying to get it to sound NPOV, which is hard, I agree that it is probably the greatest match in Liverpool's history (greatest in my living memory anyway), but other editors might disagree. We've got to try and word it right so it puts the point across about the match, yet does it in a neutral tone, not an easy task. <a href="User_NapHit" title="User:NapHit">NapHit</a> (<a href="User_talk_NapHit" title="User talk:NapHit">talk</a>) 23:09, 22 December 2011 (UTC)</dd>
