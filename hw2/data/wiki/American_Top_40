<p>Co-creator Casey Kasem hosted the original <i>AT40</i> from its inauguration on July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988 and returned to host the revived version from March 28, 1998 to January 3, 2004. (For much of the interim, he hosted the competing <i><a href="Casey's_Top_40" title="Casey's Top 40">Casey's Top 40</a></i>.) Its other two regular hosts have been <a href="Shadoe_Stevens" title="Shadoe Stevens">Shadoe Stevens</a> (1988–1995) and current host <a href="Ryan_Seacrest" title="Ryan Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> (since 2004) Currently, <i>AT40</i> with Seacrest airs in two different formats - one for <a href="Contemporary_Hit_Radio" title="Contemporary Hit Radio" class="mw-redirect">Contemporary Hit Radio</a> and one for <a href="Adult_Contemporary" title="Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Adult Contemporary</a> (formerly <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary" title="Hot Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Hot Adult Contemporary</a>) stations - with no on-air differentiation other than the charts themselves. Kasem is still heard in two weekly replays of vintage shows from the '70s and '80s, respectively.</p>
<p>As its title implies, <i>AT40</i> counts down the forty most popular songs in the United States of America, from #40 to #1. The show used <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> charts in its early years, touting it as "the only source" for the countdown; then, switched to those from <i><a href="Radio_and_Records" title="Radio and Records" class="mw-redirect">Radio and Records</a></i> upon its late 1990s return.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The charts currently are based on data from <a href="Mediabase" title="Mediabase">Mediabase</a>, and published in the Tuesday Edition of <i><a href="USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i>.</p>

The program was hosted by <a href="Casey_Kasem" title="Casey Kasem">Casey Kasem</a> and co-created by Kasem; <a href="Don_Bustany" title="Don Bustany">Don Bustany</a>; <a href="Tom_Rounds" title="Tom Rounds">Tom Rounds</a>; and 93/KHJ Program Director Ron Jacobs, who produced and directed the various production elements. Rounds was also the marketing director; the initial funder was California strawberry grower <a href="Driscoll's" title="Driscoll's">Tom Driscoll</a>.</p>
<p>The show began as a three-hour program written and directed by Bustany, counting down the top 40 songs on <i>Billboard</i>'s <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">Hot 100</a> Singles chart. The show quickly gained popularity once it was commissioned, and expanded to a four hour-program on October 7, 1978, to reflect the increasing average length of singles on <i>Billboard</i>'s Hot 100 chart. The producing staff expanded to eight people, some of them still in the business: Nikki Wine, Ben Marichal, <a href="../../w/index-title=Scott_Paton&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Scott Paton (page does not exist)">Scott Paton</a>, Matt Wilson, <a href="../../w/index-title=Merrill_Shindler&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Merrill Shindler (page does not exist)">Merrill Shindler</a>, <a href="Guy_Aoki" title="Guy Aoki">Guy Aoki</a>, Ronnie Allen and <a href="../../w/index-title=Sandy_Stert_Benjamin&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Sandy Stert Benjamin (page does not exist)">Sandy Stert Benjamin</a>. (Bustany retired from <i>AT40</i> in 1989; since 1994, he has hosted a political talk show on listener-sponsored <a href="KPFK" title="KPFK">KPFK</a>.) By the early 1980s, the show could be heard on 520 stations in the United States<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> and around the world in 50 countries.</p>

<p>During Kasem's run as host, the AT40 show had a number of popular and distinguishing features:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Bios &amp; stories:</b> Most segments of the show included two countdown songs. Often Kasem would introduce the second song in the segment with a "story" about the song and/or its recording artist (often <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/teaser" class="extiw" title="wikt:teaser">teased</a> at the preceding commercial break), with the No. 1 song frequently being preceded by a story. Here is an example from the week of October 8, 1983:</li>
</ul>

<dd><i>Stunning achievement for 33-year-old New York born <a href="Jim_Steinman" title="Jim Steinman">Jim Steinman</a>. Jim was writing musicals when he was going to <a href="Amherst_College" title="Amherst College">Amherst College</a> in Massachusetts. But not just your basic rock &amp; roll tunes, but words and music for a full-blown musical called the</i> Dream Engine<i>. That show was seen by a man who heads up the <a href="New_York_Shakespeare_Festival" title="New York Shakespeare Festival">New York Shakespeare Festival</a>, <a href="Joseph_Papp" title="Joseph Papp">Joseph Papp</a>, and he was so impressed, that he bought the rights to it and commissioned Jim Steinman to write another musical. Jim came up with a show called</i> More Than You Deserve<i>. And it was at auditions for that show, that he met a singer calling himself <a href="Meat_Loaf" title="Meat Loaf">Meat Loaf</a>. The two men started working together and that collaboration resulted in Jim's writing and arranging songs for Meat Loaf, including the big hit "<a href="Two_out_of_Three_Ain't_Bad" title="Two out of Three Ain't Bad" class="mw-redirect">Two out of Three Ain't Bad</a>". In 1981 Jim Steinman released his first solo album</i> <a href="Bad_for_Good" title="Bad for Good">Bad for Good</a><i>. It featured the Top 40 hit "<a href="Rock_and_Roll_Dreams_Come_Through" title="Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through">Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through</a>". But so far it seems as though the thing that Jim Steinman does best, is write and arrange songs for other artists. And his latest productions are his biggest yet: The number 2 and the number 1 song this week. Probably first time on the chart for one individual. We just heard the number 2 song he wrote and produced for <a href="Air_Supply" title="Air Supply">Air Supply</a>, "<a href="Making_Love_out_of_Nothing_at_All" title="Making Love out of Nothing at All" class="mw-redirect">Making Love out of Nothing at All</a>". Now here is the other one, the one at the very top. (drumroll) The most popular song in the land, for the second consecutive week is a hit written and produced by Jim Steinman. At number 1 <a href="Bonnie_Tyler" title="Bonnie Tyler">Bonnie Tyler</a>'s "<a href="Total_Eclipse_of_the_Heart" title="Total Eclipse of the Heart">Total Eclipse of the Heart</a>."</i></dd>

<ul>
<li><b>"Number" jingles:</b> Occasionally a song would be preceded by a brief audio clip of a group of singers announcing the song's position on the chart (e.g. "Number 40!"). This was especially common for the first song played in each hour of the show, but was usually not done for the #1 song (which was usually introduced with a drum roll), or for songs preceded by a story. The "number" jingles were updated and re-recorded from time to time, and by the mid-1980s the show had begun using two sets of "number" jingles: the standard set, to be used with up-tempo songs; and a softer alternate set, usually used with low-key or romantic songs.</li>
<li><b>Chart trivia:</b> AT40 also featured several question letters in each show, where a listener would write to ask a chart trivia question. Sometimes these letters led to an extra song being played, though this became less common as songs increased in length in the 1980s.</li>
<li><b>Long Distance Dedication:</b> This feature had evolved from a spoken-word 45 single that Kasem had recorded in 1964, "Letter from Elaina".<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The LDD feature began with the August 26, 1978 broadcast, two months before the show expanded to four hours (the first LDD, located in the mail by staffer Matt Wilson, was "<a href="Desiree_(song)" title="Desiree (song)">Desiree</a>" by <a href="Neil_Diamond" title="Neil Diamond">Neil Diamond</a>, sent in by a man whose girlfriend, named Desiree, was moving to Germany to live with parents on an American air base). When that show was rebroadcast the weekend of August 25–26, 2007, Kasem recorded two optional segments (played at the discretion of the station) in which he did phone interviews with the man and his former girlfriend about the LDD. Most shows featured two long distance dedications; one would be taken care of during each half of the show. (Sometimes a song currently in the countdown would also be requested as a LDD; in such cases, Kasem would typically read the dedication first, and sometimes not even announce the song's chart status until after the song was played.) This feature endured on AT40 into Shadoe Stevens' run as host of the show, from 1988 to '95, and has also followed Casey (first as the "Request and Dedication") on his <a href="Westwood_One" title="Westwood One">Westwood One</a> shows and then back as the LDD when he returned to AT40 in 1998. Long Distance Dedications were dropped from AT40 after Ryan Seacrest became host in 2004, but they continued as part of Kasem's adult contemporary countdowns.</li>
<li><b>Top Three recaps:</b> Beginning the weekend of February 24–25, 1979, a recap of the previous week's top three songs started off each AT40 episode. Originally all three songs would actually be played before the countdown began in earnest, but when time constraints became an issue, Kasem would simply announce the #3 and #2 songs and play only the #1 song; or just announce all three songs before beginning the current week's countdown. By mid-1983, abbreviated recaps had become the norm.</li>
<li><b>Dropoffs:</b> Generally during the first hour on most shows, Casey would announce songs that had left the top 40 that week.</li>
<li><b>#1's on other Billboard charts:</b> Casey would give a rundown on songs and albums that have made #1 on other Billboard charts, such as country, soul/R&amp;B, and dance/disco. These would typically be announced during the Top 10, often before the #1 song on AT40.</li>
<li><b>Predicting next week's #1 song:</b> For a time in 1972 and 1973, following the week's #1 song, Casey would try to predict what the #1 song would be on the following week's countdown, based on a poll of the AT40 staff. During the 46-week period that the predictions were used, the poll was successful only 22 weeks, and failures 24 weeks. The final song predicted, on the December 8, 1973 broadcast, was <i><a href="The_Most_Beautiful_Girl" title="The Most Beautiful Girl">The Most Beautiful Girl</a></i> by <a href="Charlie_Rich" title="Charlie Rich">Charlie Rich</a>, which was #1 the next week.</li>
<li><b>Great Radio Stations:</b> Once an hour, generally halfway into the hour, Casey would give a list of three or four radio stations that carry AT40, beginning each list with <i>"American Top 40" is heard in the fifty states and around the world every week on great radio stations like...</i>. Usually at least once a program, a foreign AT40 affiliate, or a mention of <a href="American_Forces_Network" title="American Forces Network">Armed Forces Radio</a>, is given, usually as the last station in the list. In addition, new AT40 affiliates are mentioned at the top of one of the hours (never the first hour). The multiple station mentions became a regular feature in 1972; prior to then, only one station would be mentioned per hour. The first station mentioned on AT40 was KMEN (now <a href="KKDD" title="KKDD">KKDD</a>) in <a href="San_Bernardino,_California" title="San Bernardino, California">San Bernardino, California</a>, on the August 29, 1970 program.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li><b>Special Reports:</b> Occasionally, Casey would do a special report on a particular subject involving the music industry, usually related to a particular song or artist on that week's countdown. For example, when <a href="Musical_Youth" title="Musical Youth">Musical Youth</a> were in the countdown in 1983 with <i><a href="Pass_the_Dutchie" title="Pass the Dutchie">Pass the Dutchie</a></i>, Casey did a report on the history of <a href="Reggae" title="Reggae">reggae</a> music.</li>
<li><b>Whatever happened to...:</b> Casey would periodically do a segment giving an update on an artist who has not been on the charts for some time.</li>
<li><b>Oldies:</b> During its first year, each AT40 show would feature 3 or 4 "oldies", or chart topping songs of the past. Normally, one old song would air per hour, which at the time mirrored the format of most Top 40 stations. Most of the oldies included were from the Rock 'N Roll era (post 1955). But occasionally, songs by pre-rock artists like Kay Starr, Perry Como or Nat King Cole would be included. Each song was heavily promoted by Casey and contained a story about the artist or some sort of fact making it relevant to the contemporary audience. By the fall of 1971, only 1 old song appeared per show. The following year, the "oldie" feature was dropped altogether. Oldies were brought back to AT40 in the fall of 1975 under the title "AT40 Extra". But the feature was phased out again by the end of 1976. Old songs would rarely appear again until the AT40 Archives feature began in 1978. Today, some classic rock stations airing re-runs of these early shows will edit some of the "oldies" features out of the broadcast, as songs from the 40s, 50s and 60s do not reflect the stations' mostly 70s and 80s music format.</li>
<li><b>AT40 Archives:</b> Once the show expanded to four hours, each of the first three hours ended with the "AT40 Archives" segment that featured a number one song of the past. From October 1978 to June 1980 the number one songs of the 1970s were featured in the "AT40 Archives", and from June 1980 to November 1981 the number one songs of the 1960s were featured. The "AT40 Archives" feature was gone by the end of November 1981; for a short time in 1985, however, the show did feature a segment known as the "AT40 Hall of Fame" spotlighting a noteworthy artist (who may or may not have been charting that week).</li>
<li><b>Commercial bumpers:</b> Many commercial breaks generally have a singing jingle at the start and end of the breaks. At the start of each break is generally the singers singing either "Casey's coast to coast" or "The hits from coast to coast"; both were used interchangeably. The end of the breaks are marked by the singers singing the name of the program, "American Top 40". The bumpers were originally designed so that stations with no local ads at that point could continue straight to the next segment, with the bumpers changing to a mere jingle: "Casey's coast to coast American Top 40".</li>
<li><b>Bumper music:</b> The end of each hour's worth of programming would typically be indicated by an approximately one-minute-long piece of nondescript <a href="Bumper_music" title="Bumper music">bumper music</a>. For the first few years of the program, the bumper music was merely the AT40 theme, but beginning in 1978, different pieces began to be used. Like the "number" jingles and the AT40 theme music, this musical segment was occasionally updated and re-recorded, but its only distinguishing feature was the occasional use of the AT40 theme as a <a href="Leitmotif" title="Leitmotif">leitmotif</a>. This bumper music was typically and often cut off before it ended by the local station carrying the program, usually to give the <a href="Station_identification" title="Station identification">station identification</a> before starting the next hour, and was also used by stations to "pad out" the show so that it would always end on time. (The first weekend <a href="XM_Satellite_Radio" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> played AT40 shows, the entire bumper music would be played as they were all played completely uncut, but later they would play the station identification for the XM channels they were on.)</li>
<li><b>Sign-off:</b> After the #1 song was played, the bumper music would begin playing, and over that, Kasem would typically give that week's chart date and read the end credits, then sign off with what would become his, and the show's, unofficial motto: <i>"Keep your feet on the ground, and keep reaching for the stars."</i> In the early years of the show, he usually added "and keep your radio tuned right where it is"; this phrase had returned to the show by the time the <i>AT40</i> brand name was revived in the late 1990s (Kasem had used it also on "Casey's Top 40" and its Adult Contemporary-format spinoffs). Even his sign-off music became popular, as "<a href="Shuckatoom" title="Shuckatoom">Shuckatoom</a>" (written by: <a href="../James_R._Kirk" title="James R. Kirk">James R. Kirk</a>) became a highly requested song, although it was never used apart from the show.</li>
</ul>
<p>Although the show's format obviously implied an average of ten countdown songs per hour (once the show had gone to a four-hour format), this was not rigidly enforced; however, by the mid-1980s it had become increasingly rare for the final hour of the show to have any more than the top eleven or any fewer than the top nine songs left to play. The songs' run times determined how many would comfortably fit into each hour. The show bent to fit the Billboard rankings which, to many listeners, were sacred, and some songs had to be edited (in addition to whatever edits had been done for single release), with a verse and/or chorus chopped out, in order to fit into the show. But Casey and his producers never lost sight of the fact that the same music was being played on other stations everywhere, and that the stories behind the songs were the chief reason that listeners tuned to AT40.</p>

<p>In 1988, Kasem left the show over contract concerns with ABC. Industry trade paper <i>Billboard</i> magazine reported that the main disputes between Kasem and Watermark/ABC were over his salary, because of declining ratings and a smaller group of stations airing the show. Casey's final AT40 show aired on August 6, 1988. At no point during that final show did Kasem ever let on that any changes were afoot, and simply omitted the phrase "join me next week" while closing the show.</p>
<p>Kasem was replaced by <a href="Shadoe_Stevens" title="Shadoe Stevens">Shadoe Stevens</a>, whose first <i>American Top 40</i> show aired on August 13, 1988, on 1,014 stations.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Kasem joined the <a href="Westwood_One" title="Westwood One">Westwood One</a> radio network less than a year later to start a rival show, <i><a href="Casey's_Top_40" title="Casey's Top 40">Casey's Top 40</a></i>. Many AT40 listeners were upset by Kasem's departure and, as a result, many stations dropped <i>American Top 40</i> in favor of <i>Casey's Top 40</i> once it hit the airwaves on January 21, 1989. In an attempt to win back an audience, AT40 tried new show features, including interview clips, music news, top 5 flashbacks, and previews of upcoming chart hits (called the "AT40 Sneek Peek"<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup>). AT40 in its later Shadoe years frequently used a "No Nuttin'" gimmick, in which the number jingle was followed by the song, with no introduction by Shadoe; this tactic irked critics of the show.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p><i>Casey's Top 40</i> was based on the Contemporary Hit Radio/Pop tracks chart in <i><a href="Radio_&_Records" title="Radio &amp; Records">Radio &amp; Records</a></i> magazine, which at the time was the same chart source as <a href="Rick_Dees" title="Rick Dees">Rick Dees</a>' <i>Weekly Top 40</i>. <i>American Top 40</i> was briefly canceled in the USA on July 9, 1994,<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> when then-owner <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> withdrew the show and acquired the rights to rival <i><a href="Rick_Dees_Weekly_Top_40" title="Rick Dees Weekly Top 40">Rick Dees Weekly Top 40</a></i> (since headed back to <a href="Citadel_Media_Networks" title="Citadel Media Networks" class="mw-redirect">ABC Radio/Citadel Media</a>). <i>AT40</i> ended up in the hands of <a href="Radio_Express" title="Radio Express">Radio Express</a><sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> (its overseas distributors since the 1980s, founded by AT40 co-founder Tom Rounds),<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> and was also canceled in the remaining foreign markets on January 28, 1995. These foreign markets replaced it with a similar format called <i><a href="The_World_Chart_Show" title="The World Chart Show" class="mw-redirect">The World Chart Show</a></i>.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=American_Top_40&action=edit&section=5.php.html" title="Edit section: 1998-2003: American Top 40 returns; second Casey Kasem era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="1998-2003:_American_Top_40_returns.3B_second_Casey_Kasem_era">1998-2003: American Top 40 returns; second Casey Kasem era</span></h3>
<p>In 1997, Casey Kasem acquired the rights to the <i>American Top 40</i> name. At the time, Kasem was still doing <i>Casey's Top 40</i> and he went to his syndicator looking to change the name of his program, as the name had not been used since Shadoe Stevens' <i>AT40</i> was cancelled in 1995. Westwood One would not grant Kasem's request and as a result, Kasem ended his program and left Westwood One. In 1998, he pitched the revived <i>AT40</i> idea to AMFM Radio Networks, which was owned by <a href="Clear_Channel_Communications" title="Clear Channel Communications">Chancellor Media</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and on March 28, 1998 the brand new <i>American Top 40</i> began airing. In addition to the revived <i>AT40</i>, Kasem's other programs done for <a href="Adult_contemporary" title="Adult contemporary" class="mw-redirect">adult contemporary</a> stations moved with him to AMFM and most Chancellor-owned stations with Top 40 and AC formats began airing the shows (see <a href="index.html#Spin-off_programming" title="American Top 40">Spin-off programming</a> below).</p>
<p>The resurrected <i>American Top 40</i> kept the <i>Radio and Records</i> CHR/Pop chart previously used for "Casey's Top 40" and was used as the basis for the show for the majority of this period. The only exception was a brief period from October 2000 to August 2001 when an obscure <a href="Mediabase" title="Mediabase">Mediabase</a> chart was used. This chart had a rather ambiguous <a href="Recurrent_rotation" title="Recurrent rotation">recurrent rule</a>, which would see songs removed weekly from the chart from as high as #10.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=American_Top_40&action=edit&section=6.php.html" title="Edit section: 2004-present: Ryan Seacrest era">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="2004-present:_Ryan_Seacrest_era">2004-present: Ryan Seacrest era</span></h3>
<p>On January 10, 2004, <a href="Ryan_Seacrest" title="Ryan Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a> took over the hosting duties of <i>American Top 40</i> from Kasem, although Kasem would continue to host <i>American Top 20</i> and <i>American Top 10</i> until his retirement in July 2009.<sup id="cite_ref-retire_17-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-retire-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> With the host change, <i>AT40</i> underwent a makeover, using a new theme song and introducing several new features. These extras included interviews with celebrities (which were not restricted to musical or countdown artists), a gossip section, and an update on movies screening in cinemas. Other extras inducted on a regular basis include "AT40 Breakout", a song predicted to crack the chart within the next few weeks (formerly known as the "Out of The Box" hit); "Request Line", a segment in which Ryan Seacrest will play a song requested by a listener; "Double Play", a former hit from the artist just played; "AT40 Sleaze" (inspired by the "Dees Sleaze" segment of the <i><a href="Rick_Dees" title="Rick Dees">Rick Dees</a> Weekly Top 40</i> radio show); and "AT40 Rewind", a hit song from the past decade or so. In between songs, Seacrest and his guest hosts often make deadpan one-liners while writers and producers can be heard laughing frequently, including the security guard "Roger". Additionally, Seacrest initially opened most shows by playing the previous week's #1 song, as Kasem often did in the 1980s; this was discontinued after 2006, but in mid-2009 Seacrest began including a shorter recap segment in the show's introduction, in which he would play brief segments of the previous week's top three hits.</p>
<p>The show also began using a new chart that used no recurrent rule. On the first show with Ryan Seacrest, this led to several older songs reappearing after having dropped off many weeks earlier. Over the long term, it meant songs could spend long runs for about a year on the chart even after they went to recurrent status on other published charts. "<a href="Here_Without_You" title="Here Without You">Here Without You</a>" by <a href="3_Doors_Down" title="3 Doors Down">3 Doors Down</a> set a longevity record in 2004 for the CHR show by lasting 50 weeks before finally falling off. In 2006, "<a href="Scars_(Papa_Roach_song)" title="Scars (Papa Roach song)">Scars</a>" by <a href="Papa_Roach" title="Papa Roach">Papa Roach</a> would go on to tie the record. In 2011, <a href="Taio_Cruz" title="Taio Cruz">Taio Cruz</a> set AT40's all time longevity record with his song "<a href="Dynamite_(Taio_Cruz_song)" title="Dynamite (Taio Cruz song)">Dynamite</a>". This hit remained on the chart for 72 weeks, from July 2010 to November 2011. On the Hot AC version of AT40, "<a href="Love_Song_(Sara_Bareilles_song)" title="Love Song (Sara Bareilles song)">Love Song</a>" by <a href="Sara_Bareilles" title="Sara Bareilles">Sara Bareilles</a> set the all-time record in 2009 at 103 consecutive weeks. <i>American Top 40</i> also became more interactive, involving online song voting and <a href="E-mail" title="E-mail" class="mw-redirect">e-mail</a>. In December 2006, the series' website was revamped, and the online song voting was discontinued in favor of publishing the Hot AC chart. The website also includes a toll-free number where fans can make requests and "<a href="Shout-out" title="Shout-out" class="mw-redirect">shoutouts</a>", as they would to a local radio station, and by 2009 replayed clips of shoutouts became part of the show. Online song voting was later reinstated, with results of votes on American Top 40's website factored into the chart rankings.

<p>From January 2001 to December 2002, many radio stations aired reruns of 1980-1988 episodes under the title <i>American Top 40 Flashback</i>. The show was syndicated by <a href="Premiere_Radio_Networks" title="Premiere Radio Networks" class="mw-redirect">Premiere Radio Networks</a>. In its early weeks the shows were the original four-hour format of an <i>American Top 40</i> episode, but after the first month and a half the show was reduced to three hours.

<p>On August 4, 2006, <a href="XM_Satellite_Radio" title="XM Satellite Radio">XM Satellite Radio</a> began replays of the original 1970s and 1980s AT40 shows with Casey Kasem that were digitally remastered from the original vinyl LPs and open-reel master tapes by Shannon Lynn of <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.charismusicgroup.com">Charis Music Group</a>. The event began with a weekend long marathon of original shows, with AT40 then being added as a regular show on two of XM's Decades channels, "<a href="The_70s_on_7" title="The 70s on 7" class="mw-redirect">The 70s on 7</a>" and "<a href="The_80s_on_8" title="The 80s on 8" class="mw-redirect">The 80s on 8</a>". With the merger of <a href="Sirius_Satellite_Radio" title="Sirius Satellite Radio">Sirius Satellite Radio</a> and XM Satellite Radio, these AT40 shows began airing on both services on November 15, 2008. On the 70s on 7, it replaced the 'Satellite Survey', a Top 30 countdown of 70s hits, produced by Sirius and hosted by Dave Hoeffel. On the 80s on 8, it replaced 'The Big 40' countdown produced by Sirius and hosted by <a href="Nina_Blackwood" title="Nina Blackwood">Nina Blackwood</a>. As of October 11, 2009, Sirius XM replaced the AT40 countdown on 80s on 8 and debuted a revised version of 'The Big 40' countdown now co-hosted by four of the five original MTV VJs: Nina Blackwood, <a href="Mark_Goodman" title="Mark Goodman">Mark Goodman</a>, <a href="Alan_Hunter_(VJ)" title="Alan Hunter (VJ)">Alan Hunter</a>, and <a href="Martha_Quinn" title="Martha Quinn">Martha Quinn</a>.</p>
<p><a href="Sirius_XM_Radio" title="Sirius XM Radio">Sirius XM</a> "70s on 7" currently runs AT40 each Saturday at 12PM with encore broadcasts the following Sunday at 9AM and at 12 midnight. Most show dates roughly correspond to the current week in real time. The mix of AT40 episodes being run on XM include the year-end countdowns, which are typically run in two parts: the first half (#100-#51) in one time slot, and then the second half (#50-#1) in the following time slot. The AT40 specials are also part of XM's rotation; for instance, "AT40 Goes to the Movies" aired prior to the <a href="79th_Academy_Awards" title="79th Academy Awards">2007 Academy Awards</a>, and on February 24, "The Top 40 Acts Of The 80s So Far" aired on XM 80s the first week of July 2007. Also, "The Top 40 Songs of the Disco Era (1974-1979)" aired on Sirius XM "70s on 7" the second weekend of July 2011.</p>
<p>From October through early November 2006, <a href="Oldies" title="Oldies">oldies</a> radio station <a href="KQQL" title="KQQL">KQQL</a> in <a href="../Minneapolis/St._Paul" title="Minneapolis/St. Paul" class="mw-redirect">Minneapolis/St. Paul</a>, which is owned by <a href="Clear_Channel_Communications" title="Clear Channel Communications">Clear Channel Communications</a>, ran a series of American Top 40 episodes from the 1970s. Aside from one week, when the station attempted to air a four-hour episode from 1979 in the three-hour timeslot (resulting in the show getting cut off at #11 and the top 10 not being heard), this test run was largely successful. Because of the success, Premiere Radio Networks decided to launch "<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.premiereradio.com/shows/view/at40_70s.html">Casey Kasem's American Top 40: The 1970s</a>" into national syndication featuring the three-hour shows from 1970 to 1978, and the last three hours of shows originally aired from October 1978 through December 1979. (One original four-hour program, first aired in October 1978, was edited into a three-hour program for reairing in 2007, and the four-hour "Disco Hits" special from July 1979 with the first hour optional was aired in 2008, but until the fall of 2010, no other program from the last 15 months of the 1970s was included in the "AT40: The 70s" package. Starting in late 2010, Premiere began airing three-hour versions of four-hour AT40s from 1978-1979, beginning the broadcasts at the start of the countdown's second hour; during the spring of 2012, Premiere began making the first hour of these programs "optional," meaning that stations can choose to air all four hours of the four-hour programs, or just the last three.) Starting in 2012, whenever programs from 1970-1972 were scheduled to air, Premiere began offering affiliates the option of airing a later 1970s program instead (typically, a corresponding year from seven years later, or 1977-1979).</p>
<p>The 1980s version premiered on April 8, 2007, replacing the <i>American Top 40 Flashback</i> reruns. The shows are available in either their full original four-hour format, or an abbreviated three-hour version that omits the first hour of the show. To date, the latest program to air as part of the "AT40: The 80s" package has been August 6, 1988 – Kasem's last show with the original program, and no programs from 1988-1989 with Shadoe Stevens as host have been re-aired.</p>
<p>To date, the only re-aired classic AT40 program that featured a host other than Kasem was the March 25, 1972 show with <a href="Dick_Clark" title="Dick Clark">Dick Clark</a> as host, aired as a tribute after Clark's death.</p>
<p>Newly produced extra segments hosted by voiceover talent Larry Morgan are available for use at stations' discretion. Prior to Casey leaving Premiere Radio, these segments were hosted by his son Mike; when the series first began, these segments were hosted by one of Casey's former guest hosts, <a href="Ed_McMann" title="Ed McMann">Ed McMann</a>. These extra segments are also heard on the 80s show. KQQL was the first to sign on, airing programs beginning on December 30, 2006. Typically, the "optional extras" were songs that had yet to enter the top 40 of the Hot 100. However, some songs never reached the top 40 but had since become popular at classic hits/oldies/classic rock stations, while others were tributes to performers who had just died. For early 1970s programs, some of the "optional extras" were actually extras (i.e., "oldies") that were originally a part of the original program; in this case, Kasem's original commentary and introduction of the song were kept intact, in lieu of Morgan's voiceover.</p>
<p>In March 2008, XM Satellite Radio rebranded the XM broadcasts with the "Casey Kasem's American Top 40" name and logo used for terrestrial broadcasts, although XM still aired the commercial-free broadcasts, while Premiere Radio carries edited and recut broadcasts with commercials. Following the merger of Sirius and XM, the AT40 shows airing on those platforms have occasionally been edited. In some cases, extras and LDDs have been cut from the original broadcasts.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=American_Top_40&action=edit&section=11.php.html" title="Edit section: Billboard magazine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Billboard_magazine"><i>Billboard</i> magazine</span></h3>
<p>AT40 used the Top 40 portion of the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">Billboard Hot 100</a> singles chart from the show's inception in 1970 to November 23, 1991. The chart was widely regarded as the industry standard in tracking the most popular songs in the country, and was thus a natural choice to be used. While using these charts worked well for the first half of the 1970s, as music changed during the decade, and disco became popular on the charts, some rock stations began to drop the show because of complaints from program directors that AT40 was "playing too many songs not on their playlist."</p>
<p>This gradually became a wide schism as rock splintered into a half-dozen formats in the early 1980s. Historians have noted that no one station actually played all of the songs on the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">Billboard Hot 100</a> list, because they represented overlapping formats—hard rock, mainstream rock, heavy metal, dance, new wave, punk, rap, pop, easy listening/adult contemporary, country, and so on. Stations tended to specialize in only one or two of these formats, and completely ignore the others. As a result, AT40s weekly playlist could be very diverse in the styles and formats of the songs played.</p>
<p>One solution for the AT40 producers was to air frequent specials (at least three or four times a year) that concentrated on the classic music of the past, such as <i>Rock in the Movies,</i> <i>Top Hits of the Seventies,</i> and so on. But as Top 40 stations evolved into <a href="Contemporary_hit_radio" title="Contemporary hit radio">CHR</a>, they began to avoid syndicated shows like AT40, preferring to stick with their own special niche formats.</p>
<p>By the early <a href="1990s_in_music" title="1990s in music">1990s</a>, many songs, mostly rap or heavy metal/grunge songs, would appear on the chart being fueled by single sales, and had received low airplay; several were very long, others were too controversial or risqué for mainstream airplay (for instance, the very sexually explicit "<a href="Me_So_Horny" title="Me So Horny">Me So Horny</a>" by <a href="2_Live_Crew" title="2 Live Crew">2 Live Crew</a> made it to #26 on the Hot 100 in 1989). These songs would generally only be aired in brief snippets during the show.</p>
<p>Because of this, <i>American Top 40</i> began using the Top 40 portion from the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100_Airplay" title="Billboard Hot 100 Airplay" class="mw-redirect">Hot 100 Airplay</a> chart (then known as the Top 40 Radio Monitor) in lieu of the <a href="Billboard_Hot_100" title="Billboard Hot 100">Hot 100</a>. These songs generally scored much higher radio airplay, and some were not even released as singles (such as "Steel Bars" by <a href="Michael_Bolton" title="Michael Bolton">Michael Bolton</a>). During this time, a few songs made big debuts, including 2 that almost debuted in the #1 spot: "I'll Be There" by <a href="Mariah_Carey" title="Mariah Carey">Mariah Carey</a>, which entered <i>American Top 40</i> at #4, and "Erotica" by <a href="Madonna_(entertainer)" title="Madonna (entertainer)">Madonna</a>, which entered at #2.</p>
<p>In January 1993, <i>American Top 40</i> switched charts again, this time to the <i>Billboard</i> <a href="Top_40_Mainstream" title="Top 40 Mainstream" class="mw-redirect">Top 40 Mainstream</a> chart. This chart had more Top 40 Mainstream hits but fewer urban/dance/rap songs.</p>
<p>AT40 did not always use the official year-end chart from Billboard during the 25 years that they used their charts. In 1972 and 1973; in 1977; from 1980 to 1984; and again from 1990 to 1994, AT40 compiled its own year-end chart. These charts were very close to Billboard's, but AT40 would go with a mid-December to early-December time period where Billboard's survey year varied from year to year. AT40 matched Billboard's number one song of the year every time except in 1977, 1984, 1990 and 1993.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=American_Top_40&action=edit&section=12.php.html" title="Edit section: Radio &amp; Records magazine">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Radio_.26_Records_magazine"><i>Radio &amp; Records</i> magazine</span></h3>
<p>With the show's revival in 1998, a new chart was implemented, the top 40 portion of <i>Radio and Records</i> CHR/Pop top 50 chart, which was already in use on <i>Casey's Top 40</i>. This chart used a <a href="Recurrent_rotation" title="Recurrent rotation">recurrent rule</a> removed songs below #25 and had exceeded 26 weeks in the top 50; these removals, if they occurred in the top 40, would be reflected on the appropriate week's program. In 1999, the rule was modified to further restrict long chart runs. Songs falling below #20 with at least 20 weeks in the top 50 would now be removed.</p>
<p>On October 21, 2000 <i>American Top 40</i> began using an unpublished chart on a weekly basis for the first time in its history. The chart seemed to be a variant of the CHR/Pop chart provided by <a href="Mediabase" title="Mediabase">Mediabase</a>, the data provider to <i>Radio &amp; Records</i>. The most noticeable feature of this new chart was its ambiguous recurrent rule. Songs would be removed regularly from within the top 15, seemingly regardless of the number of weeks it had spent on the chart. This chart lasted until August 11, 2001, when AT40 returned to the <i>Radio &amp; Records</i> Pop chart. The return coincided with another modification in the recurrent rule; songs would be removed below #25 after 3 consecutive weeks without a bullet (an increase in radio plays). This change would be short-lived, and in November 2001, <i>Radio &amp; Records</i> returned to the 20 weeks/below #20 rule, which remained in place for the remainder of Kasem's tenure.</p>

<p>Beginning in the early 1990s, Casey Kasem also hosted two other shows counting down the top <a href="Adult_contemporary" title="Adult contemporary" class="mw-redirect">adult contemporary</a> hits of the week. He continued to host both shows even after Ryan Seacrest took over the reins of <i>American Top 40</i>.</p>
<p>Kasem's countdown for Mainstream and Soft Adult Contemporary radio stations debuted in 1992 under the name <i>Casey's Countdown</i>. Originally <i>Casey's Countdown</i> consisted of 25 songs, but in 1994 it was shortened to 20. With the revival of the <i>AT40</i> brand name, the AC chart became <i>American Top 20</i>. In March 2004, the Mainstream AC edition was shortened again, this time from twenty to ten songs, and became known as <i>American Top 10</i>.</p>
<p>Another show for <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary" title="Hot Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Hot Adult Contemporary</a> radio stations debuted in November 1994, since the Hot AC or "Adult Top 40" format was rapidly growing in popularity at the time. The original name of the show was <i>Casey's Hot 20</i>. Like its sister Mainstream AC show, it, too, was renamed <i>American Top 20</i> once <i>AT40</i> was relaunched (resulting in two different shows being entitled "American Top 20").</p>
<p>Originally both AC shows were three hours in length and included many <i>AT40</i> staple features, including chart "extras" and Long Distance Dedications (known as "Requests and Dedications" during the Westwood One years), as well as spotlight features on number one hits of each chart week from years past. <i>AT10</i> continued to feature Long Distance Dedications, and some additional features that were staples on the original <i>AT40</i> were re-added to both shows over the last several years, including the "Book of Records" and "Whatever Happened To...?" <i>AT10</i> also featured additional chart extras under the banner of "AT10 Spotlight," built around a particular theme (the theme for the first week of the revamped <i>AT10</i> in 2004 was "Band Members Gone Solo").</p>
<p>As with the Top 40 show, both <i>Casey's Countdown/AT20/10 AC</i> and <i>Casey's Hot 20/AT20 Hot AC</i> initially used the AC charts published by <i>Radio &amp; Records</i> from their inception until 2003, except for a brief period in 2000-2001 when both used unpublished Mediabase 24/7 charts. From 2003 to August 2006 (when <i>R&amp;R</i> stopped using Mediabase to compile its charts), both shows used the Mediabase charts. From August 2006 until the end of its run, the AC shows once again were based on unpublished charts.</p>
<p>In 2005, <a href="WLTW" title="WLTW">WLTW</a>-FM in <a href="New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> commissioned a shortened one-hour version of <i>American Top 10</i> featuring only the current hits of the week and eliminating the "extras."</p>
<p>In December, <i>AT10</i> focused on Christmas music because many of its affiliates broadcast a holiday/Christmas music format around the holiday season.</p>
<p><i>AT20</i> and <i>AT10</i> aired their final episodes on the weekend of July 4/5, 2009. The countdowns wrapped up with Kasem giving a brief history of his countdown programs and how they grew over the years, then introduced his final #1: <a href="Shinedown" title="Shinedown">Shinedown</a>'s "<a href="Second_Chance_(Shinedown_song)" title="Second Chance (Shinedown song)">Second Chance</a>" on American Top 20 and Taylor Swift's "Love Story" on American Top 10. After the respective song finished and Kasem repeated the title and how long it had been atop the <i>AT20/AT10</i> charts, both shows featured the same voicetrack of Casey's final words to his audience after 39 years of counting down the hits.</p>

<p>Kasem then closed the show with the end credits and his tagline one final time, and with that his career came to an end. Premiere Radio Networks ended the shows, choosing not to continue them with a new host. Eligible stations were offered the current American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest as an alternate program, and eligible stations wishing to keep Kasem were offered the 70s and 80s programs.

<p>Based on the success of <i>American Top 40</i>, Kasem and Don Bustany created a spinoff top 40 countdown for Watermark for Country Radio called <i><a href="American_Country_Countdown" title="American Country Countdown">American Country Countdown</a></i>, patterned after Kasem's program.

<p>Casey Kasem and Watermark's policy regarding putting <i>American Top 40</i> together was to always play the 40 most popular songs in the United States and never to ban a record from the countdown. However, whenever songs with potentially offensive lyrical content made the top 40, Watermark would send out memos to affiliated stations alerting them of the presence of that song in the countdown and sometimes provide stations with suggestions on how to edit the song out of their <i>AT40</i> broadcasts. The first song to receive this advisory was in April and May 1971, with a spoken word piece, "<a href="../The_Battle_Hymn_of_Lt._Calley" title="The Battle Hymn of Lt. Calley">The Battle Hymn of Lt.

The censorship of this song continues even today as some stations, such as <a href="WOGL" title="WOGL">WOGL</a> in <a href="Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a>, replaced this song with an optional extra when it aired a rerun of the November 18, 1972 broadcast (where it ranked at #14)<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> on December 6, 2008.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1977, radio station <a href="KSTZ" title="KSTZ">KRNQ</a> in <a href="Des_Moines,_Iowa" title="Des Moines, Iowa">Des Moines, Iowa</a>, edited out "<a href="The_Killing_of_Georgie" title="The Killing of Georgie" class="mw-redirect">The Killing of Georgie</a>" by Rod Stewart, because of the subject matter of a homosexual being murdered;<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> that song peaked at #30 on the countdown.</p>
<p>Another example of this policy dates from 1978, when Billy Joel's "<a href="Only_the_Good_Die_Young" title="Only the Good Die Young">Only the Good Die Young</a>" was on the charts. Because of the nature of the song (Joel singing about urging pre-marital sex by a teen Catholic girl, Virginia), AT40 had placed warnings in shipments to warn affiliates in highly Catholic populated areas along with a special break in the countdown for stations to substitute another song in its place. The affiliates usually used the suggestion, though some did not and no major complaints were ever heard. Many of these memos have been reprinted in Pete Battistini's book, "American Top 40 with Casey Kasem (The 1970s)."</p>
<p>Although Kasem and his crew never banned a song from airplay on the countdown, there was at least one instance in which Kasem refused to announce the title of a song on his show. When <a href="George_Michael" title="George Michael">George Michael</a>'s "<a href="I_Want_Your_Sex" title="I Want Your Sex">I Want Your Sex</a>" hit the Billboard charts in the summer of 1987, Kasem refused to announce the name of the song; only its artist (e.g., "George Michael's latest hit is up five notches this week...") Also, as had been done with previous controversial hits, because of the song's suggestiveness, the show's structure was altered slightly, so stations could opt out of the song. This pattern was also evident during the 1987 Year End countdown. The song title was mentioned five times during its chart run (6/20/1987; 6/27/1987; 7/4/1987; 9/12/1987 and 9/19/1987), during the week-ending episode of September 26, 1987, when it dropped out of the Top 40, and during the Top 100 of 1987 show; Shadoe Stevens, his successor, however did mention the title on the show from July 31, 1993 as part of the Flashback feature, as it was in the top 5 from that week in 1987. In the spring of 1991, when "<a href="People_Are_Still_Having_Sex" title="People Are Still Having Sex">People Are Still Having Sex</a>" by <a href="LaTour" title="LaTour">LaTour</a> and "<a href="I_Wanna_Sex_You_Up" title="I Wanna Sex You Up">I Wanna Sex You Up</a>" by Color Me Badd debuted the same week, their titles were announced in full.</p>
<p>Another song that had its title unannounced after its first week was "<a href="Me_So_Horny" title="Me So Horny">Me So Horny</a>" by <a href="2_Live_Crew" title="2 Live Crew">2 Live Crew</a>, in the fall of 1989 [the Shadoe Stevens era]. It was mentioned twice at the beginning of the song, and back announced once, its debut week. For the rest of its chart run, the title was never again mentioned. When the <a href="2_Live_Crew" title="2 Live Crew">2 Live Crew</a> returned to the top 40 in the Summer of 1990, with "<a href="../Banned_in_the_U.S.A._(song)" title="Banned in the U.S.A. (song)">Banned in the U.S.A.</a>", Shadoe did mention that it was the follow-up to "<a href="Me_So_Horny" title="Me So Horny">Me So Horny</a>". The song did come with edit out instructions for stations as well. Other songs around that time with edit out warnings were "<a href="The_Humpty_Dance" title="The Humpty Dance">The Humpty Dance</a>" by <a href="The_Digital_Underground" title="The Digital Underground" class="mw-redirect">The Digital Underground</a>, and "<a href="Tic_Tac_Toe" title="Tic Tac Toe" class="mw-redirect">Tic Tac Toe</a>" by Kyper.</p>
<p>As has been mentioned previously, many rock radio stations in the late 1970s adopted anti-<a href="Disco_music" title="Disco music" class="mw-redirect">disco</a> stances, and this, too, was reflected in the way some affiliates edited AT40. For example, one 1979 show featured a story about disco saving New York; again, the show was structured so that anti-disco stations could edit the story out of the show. (Notably, Kasem ended the monologue with the prediction that "disco is here to stay," which was proven false in short order, as disco rapidly fell out of fashion by 1980.)</p>
<p>More famously, on the weekend of July 7–8, 1979, <a href="Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>, <a href="Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a> AT40 affiliate <a href="WNCX" title="WNCX">WGCL</a> (now <a href="WNCX" title="WNCX">WNCX</a>), instead of carrying the "American Top 40 Top 40 Disco Songs" special because of being an anti-disco radio station, did its own version of <i>American Top 40</i> using the July 7, 1979 Billboard chart as the source with <a href="Townsend_Coleman" title="Townsend Coleman">Townsend Coleman</a> handling the hosting duties for Casey Kasem. The special Cleveland-only <i>American Top 40</i> episode did not feature the AT40 Archives, extras, or Long Distance Dedications — just the top 40 singles of that week, which was preceded by a recap of the previous week's top three. Most of the songs played were longer album versions or 12-inch extended versions. Through clever editing, Coleman also took the "Casey's Coast to Coast" jingle (pronounced "K-C's Coast to Coast") and spliced in a "T," to provide an appropriate "TC's Coast to Coast" jingle. Kasem did not learn about the deception until 1996, laughing the whole thing off by saying, "Maybe I don't <i>want</i> to hear it!"</p>
<p>Coleman's sleight-of-hand was actually the <i>second</i> time a version of the <i>AT40</i> had aired that was not quite on the up and up. According to Rob Durkee's book "American Top 40: The Countdown of the Century", Dave Morgan of WDHF (now <a href="WNUA" title="WNUA">WNUA</a>) in Chicago ghosted an edition of the program sometime in the summer of 1975. When the station's copy of the show did not arrive in time, he used <i>Billboard'</i>s list and merely played the records, apparently heavily implying that the show was <i>American Top 40</i> without actually identifying it as such. "My program director made me do it!" Morgan said years later.</p>
<p>From 1992 to 1994, two radio stations still carrying American Top 40 had to carry customized versions of the show. <a href="WPLJ" title="WPLJ">WPLJ</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> aired the show with the urban/dance/rap songs mentioned but not played and were replaced here and there by <a href="Hot_Adult_Contemporary" title="Hot Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Hot Adult Contemporary</a> leaning extras. <a href="KUBE_(FM)" title="KUBE (FM)">KUBE</a> in <a href="Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a>, <a href="../Washington_(U.S._state)" title="Washington (U.S. state)" class="mw-redirect">Washington</a> aired AT40 with a few songs that did not fit the station's Top 40 Rhythm format omitted each week. It has also been reported that <a href="WSTR_(FM)" title="WSTR (FM)">WSTR</a> in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="Atlanta, Georgia" class="mw-redirect">Atlanta, Georgia</a>, being an anti-rap station and a very Adult Contemporary-leaning CHR, edited "<a href="Another_Night_(song)" title="Another Night (song)">Another Night</a>" by <a href="Real_McCoy_(band)" title="Real McCoy (band)">Real McCoy</a> (a <a href="Eurodisco" title="Eurodisco" class="mw-redirect">Eurodisco</a> record with rap breaks) out of its broadcasts of <i>Casey's Top 40</i> in 1994, even while the song was at #1 on the show (which used the Radio &amp; Records CHR/Pop chart). "<a href="Fuck_You_(Cee_Lo_Green_song)" title="Fuck You (Cee Lo Green song)">Fuck You</a>" by <a href="Cee_Lo_Green" title="Cee Lo Green">Cee Lo Green</a> was changed to "Forget You" for radio airplay in 2010 and hit #1 the following year after re-entering the American Top 40. "<a href="Fuckin'_Perfect" title="Fuckin' Perfect" class="mw-redirect">Fuckin' Perfect</a>" by <a href="Pink_(singer)" title="Pink (singer)">Pink</a> was changed to "Perfect" for radio airplay and also hit #1 on the American Top 40. "<a href="Tonight_(I'm_Fuckin'_You)" title="Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)">Tonight (I'm Fuckin' You)</a>" by <a href="Enrique_Iglesias" title="Enrique Iglesias">Enrique Iglesias</a> was changed to "Tonight (I'm Lovin' You) for radio airplay. "<a href="Niggas_in_Paris" title="Niggas in Paris">Niggas in Paris</a>" by <a href="Jay-Z" title="Jay-Z">Jay-Z</a> &amp; <a href="Kanye_West" title="Kanye West">Kanye West</a> was changed to "In Paris" for radio airplay. "<a href="Ass_Back_Home" title="Ass Back Home">Ass Back Home</a>" by <a href="Gym_Class_Heroes" title="Gym Class Heroes">Gym Class Heroes</a>, which was changed to "Get Yourself Back Home" for radio airplay. The most recent radio edit was by <a href="Neon_Hitch" title="Neon Hitch">Neon Hitch</a> with her new song "<a href="Fuck_U_Betta" title="Fuck U Betta">Fuck U Betta</a>," it was changed to "Love U Betta" for radio airplay (this song was first played in Subway's Fresh Buzz Song of the week).</p>

<p>Additionally, the top songs of the year were counted down at the end of every year. In 1970 &amp; 1972, AT40 counted down the year's top 80 hits. In 1971 &amp; 1973, they only counted down the top 40 because of their top 40 <a href="Christmas" title="Christmas">Christmas</a> Countdowns those two years. Beginning in 1974, the top 100 songs of the year were counted down and was done so every year with few exceptions. In 1979, they did the top 50 songs of that year and followed it with the top 50 songs of the 1970s. This was done again in 1999, except only the top 40 of the year and decade were aired. In 2009, the year-end countdown took place as usual (two weeks long, with the top 100 songs of the year being counted down), but on the first week of 2010, the top 40 songs of the decade were counted down. The year-end shows were counted down over a two-week period (although stations could edit the shows into one long show) until 1983, when the year-end show ran just one week for eight hours. In 1992, the year end countdown was temporary back to its two-week format, in 1994 (the last year of the old AT40) the year end countdown was only 50, and with the AT40 return in 1998 the year end countdowns were the 2 week format (except for 1999 when it was 50).</p>
<p>During the run of "American Top 20" and "American Top 10," an updated Christmas countdown, the "Top 60 Christmas Songs," would air annually the two weeks immediately preceding Christmas.</p>
