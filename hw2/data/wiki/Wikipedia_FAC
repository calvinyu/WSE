<p>Here, we determine which articles are to be <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_articles" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles (FAs)</a>. FAs exemplify Wikipedia's very best work and satisfy the <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">FA criteria</a>. All editors are welcome to review nominations; please see the <a href="Wikipedia_Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches">review FAQ</a>.</p>
<p>Before nominating an article, nominators may wish to receive feedback by listing it at <a href="Wikipedia_Peer_review" title="Wikipedia:Peer review">Peer review</a>. Nominators must be sufficiently familiar with the subject matter and sources to deal with objections during the FAC process. Nominators who are not <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vs.aka-online.de/wppagehiststat/">significant contributors to the article</a> should consult regular editors of the article prior to a nomination. Nominators are expected to respond positively to constructive criticism and to make efforts to address objections promptly. An article should not be on Featured article candidates and <a href="Wikipedia_PR" title="Wikipedia:PR" class="mw-redirect">Peer review</a> or <a href="Wikipedia_GAN" title="Wikipedia:GAN" class="mw-redirect">Good article nominations</a> at the same time.</p>
<p>The FA director, <a href="User_Raul654" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>—or one of his delegates, <a href="User_Ucucha" title="User:Ucucha">Ucucha</a>, <a href="User_GrahamColm" title="User:GrahamColm">Graham Colm</a>, and <a href="User_Ian_Rose" title="User:Ian Rose">Ian Rose</a>—determines the timing of the process for each nomination. For a nomination to be <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates/Featured_log/February_2013" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Featured log/February 2013">promoted</a> to FA status, <a href="Wikipedia_Consensus" title="Wikipedia:Consensus">consensus</a> must be reached that it meets the criteria. Consensus is built among reviewers and nominators; the director or his delegate determines whether there is consensus. A nomination will be removed from the list and <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates/Archived_nominations/February_2013" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/Archived nominations/February 2013">archived</a> if, in the judgment of the director or his delegate:</p>
<ul>
<li>actionable objections have not been resolved;</li>
<li>consensus for promotion has not been reached;</li>
<li>insufficient information has been provided by reviewers to judge whether the criteria have been met; or</li>
<li>a nomination is unprepared, after at least one reviewer has suggested it be withdrawn.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is assumed that all nominations have good qualities; this is why the main thrust of the process is to generate and resolve <i>critical</i> comments in relation to the criteria, and why such resolution is given considerably more weight than declarations of support.</p>
<p>An editor is allowed to be the sole nominator of only one article at a time; however, two nominations may be allowed if the editor is a co-nominator on at least one of them. If a nomination is archived, the nominator(s) should take adequate time to work on resolving issues before re-nominating. None of the nominators may nominate or co-nominate any article for two weeks unless given leave to do so by a delegate; if such an article is nominated without asking for leave, a delegate will decide whether to remove it. Nominators whose nominations are archived with no (or minimal) feedback will be given exemptions.</p>
<p>Use of graphics or templates including graphics (such as {{<a href="Template_Done" title="Template:Done">done</a>}}, {{<a href="Template_Not_done" title="Template:Not done">not done</a>}} and {{<a href="Template_Xt" title="Template:Xt">xt</a>}}) are discouraged, as they slow down the page load time and lead to errors in the FAC archives.</p>
<p>A <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates/archiving" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/archiving">bot will update the article talk page</a> after the article is promoted or the nomination archived; the delay in bot processing can range from minutes to several days, and the <tt>{{FAC}}</tt> template should remain on the talk page until the bot updates <tt>{{ArticleHistory}}</tt>.</p>

<li>Before nominating an article, ensure that it meets all of the <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">FA criteria</a> and that <a href="Wikipedia_PR" title="Wikipedia:PR" class="mw-redirect">peer reviews</a> are closed and archived. The featured article toolbox (at right) can help you check some of the criteria.</li>
<li>Place <tt>{{subst:FAC}}</tt> on the talk page of the nominated article and save the page.</li>
<li>From the FAC template, click on the red "initiate the nomination" link or the blue "leave comments" link. You will see pre-loaded information; leave that text. If you are unsure how to complete a nomination, please post to <a href="Wikipedia_talk_FAC" title="Wikipedia talk:FAC" class="mw-redirect">the FAC talk page</a> for assistance.</li>
<li>Below the preloaded title, complete the nomination page, sign with ~~~~ and save the page.</li>
<li>Copy this text: <tt>{{Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/name of nominated article/archiveNumber}}</tt> (substituting Number), and <b><span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="../../w/index-title=Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates&action=edit&section=1.php.html">edit this page</a></span></b> (i.e., the page you are reading at the moment), pasting the template at the top of the list of candidates. Replace "name of ..." with the name of your nomination. This will <a href="Wikipedia_Transclusion" title="Wikipedia:Transclusion">transclude</a> the nomination into this page. In the event that the title of the nomination page differs from this format, use the page's title instead.</li>
</ol>
<p><span style="font-size:1.4em">Supporting and opposing</span></p>
<ul>
<li>To respond to a nomination, click the "Edit" link to the right of the article nomination (not the "Edit this page" link for the <i>whole</i> FAC page). All editors are welcome to review nominations; see <a href="Wikipedia_Wikipedia_Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches" title="Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2008-04-07/Dispatches">the review FAQ</a> for an overview of the review process.</li>
<li>To support a nomination, write *'''Support''', <b>followed</b> by your reason(s), which should be based on a full reading of the text. If you have been a significant contributor to the article before its nomination, please indicate this. A reviewer who specializes in certain areas of the FA criteria should indicate whether the support is applicable to all of the criteria.</li>
<li>To oppose a nomination, write *'''Object''' or *'''Oppose''', <b>followed</b> by your reason(s). Each objection must provide <b>a specific rationale that can be addressed</b>. If nothing can be done in principle to address the objection, the director may ignore it. References on style and grammar do not always agree; if a contributor cites support for a certain style in a standard reference work or other authoritative source, reviewers should consider accepting it. Reviewers who object are strongly encouraged to return after a few days to check whether their objection has been addressed. To withdraw the objection, strike it out (with <tt>&lt;s&gt; ... &lt;/s&gt;</tt>) rather than removing it. Alternatively, reviewers may transfer lengthy, resolved commentary to the FAC archive talk page, leaving a link in a note on the FAC archive.</li>
<li>To provide constructive input on a nomination without specifically supporting or objecting, write *'''Comment''' followed by your advice.</li>
<li>For ease of editing, a reviewer who enters lengthy commentary may want to create a neutral fourth-level sub-section, named either ==== Review by EditorX ==== or ==== Comments by EditorX ====. Please do not create subsections for short statements of support or opposition—for these a simple *'''Support''',*'''Oppose''', or *'''Comment''' followed by your statement of opinion, is sufficient. Please do not use emboldened sub-headings with semi-colons, as these create <a href="Wikipedia_ACCESS" title="Wikipedia:ACCESS" class="mw-redirect">accessibility</a> problems.</li>
<li>If a nominator feels that an Oppose has been addressed, they should say so after the reviewer's signature rather than striking out or splitting up the reviewer's text. Per <a href="Wikipedia_TALK" title="Wikipedia:TALK" class="mw-redirect">talk page guidelines</a>, nominators should not cap, alter, strike, break up, or add graphics to comments from other editors; replies are added below the signature on the reviewer's commentary. If a nominator finds that an opposing reviewer is not returning to the nomination page to revisit improvements, this should be noted on the nomination page, with a diff to the reviewer's talk page showing the request to reconsider.</li>

<p>This is the fifteenth episode of <a href="The_X-Files_(season_9)" title="The X-Files (season 9)">eight season</a> of <i><a href="The_X-Files" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a></i>, and a big episode for the series; it features the real return of <a href="David_Duchovny" title="David Duchovny">David Duchovny</a> as <a href="Fox_Mulder" title="Fox Mulder">Fox Mulder</a>. I am nominating this for featured article because I feel it is ready for the next big step. It is currently a GA as well as an A-Class article. I implemented much of what I learned from my previous <a href="The_Sixth_Extinction_II__Amor_Fati" title="The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati">FAN attempt</a>. It has been copyedited, as well as peer-reviewed by three different editors, including Noleander, The Rambling Man, and Ruby 2010/2013. The article reads well, features illustrations (and the non-free images have proper licenses), and the references are properly formatted and of high quality. I feel that the article's prose, coupled with its scope, MoS compliance, images, etc. would make it a perfect candidate for a Featured Article.--<font face="Arial Black"><a href="../User_Gen._Quon" title="User:Gen.

<dd>Thanks for the comments. Agree re Hubert and the dates in the lead, working. Im inclined to keep the lead image, not sure is disallowed, and in this instance justified I think because of the orientation of the elements of the painting and because the panel is a diptych wing. Checking out re the caps on the inscriptions, yes MOS:ETY is hard to parse&#160;;) <a href="User_Ceoil" title="User:Ceoil">Ceoil</a> (<a href="User_talk_Ceoil" title="User talk:Ceoil">talk</a>) 20:39, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Agree the lead image should look left per Ceoil's reasoning. <a href="User_Truthkeeper88" title="User:Truthkeeper88">Truthkeeper</a> (<a href="User_talk_Truthkeeper88" title="User talk:Truthkeeper88">talk</a>) 21:02, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

</dl>
<p>In the discussion of the possible diptych I am confused as to whether the existing panel was on the left or on the right hand side. If commentators disagree then this should be clearly stated in the text. The lead states: "Most art historians see the panel as the <i>right</i> wing of a dismantled diptych... " but the section "Copies and lost diptych" starts with "Art historians believe that there are a number of indicators that the panel was created as the <i>left-hand</i> wing of a dismantled diptych." but then states "Harbison believes the panel is "almost certainly only the right-hand wing of a devotional diptych"." <a href="../../w/index-title=User_Aa77zz&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="User:Aa77zz (page does not exist)">Aa77zz</a> (<a href="User_talk_Aa77zz" title="User talk:Aa77zz">talk</a>) 08:41, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks. It was likely the left-hand wing, cleared up now. <a href="User_Ceoil" title="User:Ceoil">Ceoil</a> (<a href="User_talk_Ceoil" title="User talk:Ceoil">talk</a>) 23:00, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>No, I didn't, because I misread the instructions. I thought they referred to re-nominating the article that just failed; I didn't see that they referred to any other article.

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because… I think it meets the criteria. The Flying Eagle cent was the first U.S. small cent.

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because I think it says everything about bal maidens (female manual labourers in the mines of south-west Britain) that any general reader could reasonably want to know. A <a href="Wikipedia_Peer_review/Bal_maiden/archive1" title="Wikipedia:Peer review/Bal maiden/archive1">peer review</a> didn't get any responses, but I wasn't really surprised by that as everyone I'm aware of with in interest in the topic had already looked at it by that point. As mentioned at the peer review, this relies very heavily on Lynne Mayers but that's purely because her series is so definitive, it's unlikely anyone will ever write another significant work on the topic. None of this material is disputed or controversial, so there's not an "only giving one point of view" problem.&#160;<a href="User_Mogism" title="User:Mogism" class="mw-redirect">Mogism</a>&#160;(<a href="User_talk_Mogism#top" title="User talk:Mogism">talk</a>) 18:52, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p>A great piece of work in a topic that I'm interested in, so I have a few suggestions...</p>
<ul>
<li>Firstly, although I don't have the 2008 edition of Mayers' book, I do have a copy of the Hypatia Trust 1st edition which is A4 sized with 246 pages. The pagination is evidently different, but does Mayers mention any significant changes in the 2nd ed.?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The correct term for what the article calls a <i>metal</i> mine or <i>metal</i> mining throughout is <i><a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/metalliferous" class="extiw" title="wikt:metalliferous">metalliferous</a></i>, as used by Mayers herself.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Lead photo</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Bal maidens in traditional protective clothing, 1890" — Are they not wearing their clean white aprons which were exchanged for rough hessian ones for work? There's a similar-looking photo on p.48 of Mayers 1st ed. showing "two Dolcoath balmaidens, wearing their best aprons [...] One has her work apron over her arm".</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Mechanisation and the 18th century copper boom</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"In 1678 Clement Clerke introduced the coal-powered reverberatory furnace, allowing metal to be separated from fine grains of ore which had previously been discarded as waste, greatly increasing the quantity of metal extractable from ore.[35]" — I think this gives the wrong impression both regarding the date and the fate of the "fines" (the older method of smelting tin was the <a href="Blowing_house" title="Blowing house">blowing house</a>). Mayers herself seems confused here (at least in the 1st ed.) Since this isn't central to the article, I think something simpler like "The introduction of the coal-powered reverberatory furnace greatly improved the yield" would be better.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Working conditions</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Other contemporary observers noted that bal maidens were generally good natured and well behaved,[118] and often devoutly religious,[117] but it is well-documented that bal maidens typically took great pride in their own appearance and clothing.[119]" — should that really be a "but" in there?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dt>Notes</dt>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Note b. should mention that that first reference is to "ball maidens" [<i><a href="Sic" title="Sic">sic</a></i>]. Out of interest the text (as reported the next day by another newspaper) was apparently as follows:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">The disasters which occur from the want of a Breakwater at Padstow prove the expediency of such an erection, by means of which the brig Isabella lately wrecked near that port and her valuable cargo would in all probability have been preserved. The country-people in that neighbourhood have been for some time busily employed in securing articles which belonged to the cargo of this vessel. On Wednesday evening a box of figs was discovered on Saint Miniver Common by a party of females on the look-out for concealed plunder; who were attacked by some ball maidens returning from a mine. After a sharp contest of two hours, victory declared in favour of the ball maidens who bore away the prize.</div>

</blockquote>
<dl>
<dd>Not just "rough in speech", eh!</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Note d. "Streaming was the original means of collecting ore which had eroded from mineral deposits and settled on stream and river beds, by separating the heavy metal from the lighter surrounding mud and gravel." — <i>metal</i> should read <i>ore</i> here, but even with that change this still isn't correct, <s>something like "<a href="Placer_mining" title="Placer mining">Streaming</a> involved the collection of ore-bearing pebbles from <a href="Alluvial" title="Alluvial" class="mw-redirect">alluvial</a> deposits in river and stream beds where they had accumulated after being eroded from the ore-bearing <a href="Lode" title="Lode">lodes</a>." would be more accurate.</s> (That's wrong too - I'll come back on this)</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope this helps, may have some more later. &#160;—<a href="User_Smalljim" title="User:Smalljim">S<small>MALL</small></a><a href="User_talk_Smalljim#top" title="User talk:Smalljim"><small>JIM</small></a>&#160; 18:52, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<ul>
<li>From the preface to the second edition, the most significant changes from the original Hypatia work are "to extend the geographic scope to include Dartmoor and the Teign and Exe valleys; a more extensive use of the 1952 scrapbook compiled by the Troon Women's Institute; use of the "Day and Night Book" of two captains from Dolcoath in 1822-23; a much fuller treatment of 19th century tin streaming; a change to <i>bal maiden</i> rather than <i>balmaiden</i> as a more authentic usage". (Translation for readers unfamiliar with UK geography: 1st ed only covers Cornwall but 2nd ed covers the whole southwest.)</li>
<li>I agree, but "metal mine" is repeated so often, for obvious reasons, that I'm reluctant to use the term "metalliferous". I know it's technically the correct term, but there's no risk of "metal mine" misleading readers into thinking a mine was made of metal, as opposed to extracting metals. If people think it's a problem I can change it, obviously.</li>
<li>Impossible to say, as the photo isn't high enough quality to tell if the aprons are work aprons that haven't yet got dirty, or clean aprons that they're going to take off as soon as the photographer has finished. I think it would be very confusing to readers to have a long explanation in the caption, since the aprons would have looked the same in either case.</li>
<li>Agree and have removed. I think it's worth mentioning the introduction of the furnaces, as it explains why the industry suddenly became efficient enough for large-scale operations to start, but there's no need to go into technical details.</li>
<li>I think the "but" is appropriate in the context of "were they spendthrifts who blew all their spare cash on fancy clothes?". In devoutly Methodist 19th century Cornwall, "devoutly religious" and "pride in their own appearance" would have been considered incompatible.</li>
<li>Agreed, added.</li>
<li>Simplified further to "by collecting ore-bearing pebbles from river and stream beds" - again, readers don't need the technical details.</li>

<dd>Thanks for all that, especially the edition differences - looks like I can refer to the first ed. text without too much trouble.
<ul>
<li>Metal mine — well, if the reliable sources use the full term... But I'm happy to see what others think.</li>
<li>Aprons — on p.49 of my Meyers it specifically says "The best one ... worn to and from the mine as well as for photographs and special occasions." If not in the caption, a mention of how dirty the hessian aprons got would be useful (we have a brief description from Minnie Andrews, and it's covered in Schwartz's <i>Tin Mines and Miners of Lanner</i> (2001) p. 87 <a href="Special_BookSources/1841140198" class="internal mw-magiclink-isbn">ISBN 1-84114-019-8</a>).</li>
<li>Reverb. furnace — the way it's worded leads one to assume that 1678 was the date it was introduced here, which it wasn't: my Mayers only says "at the beginning of the 18th century".</li>
<li>Pride in appearance — OK, I see what you're getting at, but to me the phrasing in the text doesn't express that clearly; and is that actually what the sources are implying?</li>
<li>Pebbles — no, sorry for the confusion caused by my strike-out. That would have been the very earliest means of collecting ore (before streaming): I'll sleep on this!</li>

<p>Well, today I've done what I should have done yesterday – I printed out the article and worked through it, pencil in hand. I'm sorry to say that the whole thing ended up covered in adverse comments. Now I'm not an experienced FA reviewer (I didn't even read the instructions about not using semicolon emboldened headings!), nor am I familiar with how the <a href="Wikipedia_FACR" title="Wikipedia:FACR" class="mw-redirect">FA criteria</a> are currently being interpreted. I know I can be prone to <a href="Nitpicking_(pastime)" title="Nitpicking (pastime)">nitpicking</a>, too, so I think I'd better wait for some other opinions before I consider making further in-depth comment: I don't want to potentially waste your (or my!) time. Using the broad FA criteria, though, I'd say that the section structure is insufficient to support the content – the text often diverges quite widely from the stated section topic. And regarding comprehensiveness, there's no discussion of "clay maidens" or of BMs work in mining for other minerals, to which Mayers (1st ed.) devotes two chapters. I'd like to see, too, more about the disconnect between how the BMs were seen and reported on by (privileged) visitors and the apparent truth revealed by the mine inspections (Mayers' "Myth and Reality" chapter).

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because... "Cry Me a River" is one of the most memorable and iconic songs recorded by Justin Timberlake. Thanks to that, I found a descent amount of information which I placed within the article page. This is the second FA nomination; regarding the first there were some prose issues that thanks to the help from my fellow editors such as Wikipedian Penguin, Dan56 and Mark Arsten I believe they are gone. I would ask the editors who oppose to provide their reason for such and add additional comments how can I improve the article.

<li><b>Comment</b>, with an <b>oppose</b> for now. I agree with the nom when he says that various issues with the prose have been dealt with since the last FAC. However, various parts of the article have left me baffled and confused. For example, after reading "...about a brokenhearted man who cannot accept the past", I viewed the attributed source and ended up with something completely contradictory to this statement. The source doesn't say he "cannot accept the past", it says that he "refuses to look back" <i>despite</i> being previously broken-hearted, which is the complete opposite of what the article says. I also didn't understand the part which said "who may represent Spears"—I haven't seen the video, so perhaps this was some sort of commentary from the director? I've only looked at the lead, but it appears that some work will need to be completed before the article is going to be considered our best work. I know I'm probably going to get a bunch of angry comments like last time for posting this, but to be honest FAC is all about determining if an article is of professional standard to be considered Wiki's best work. I would rather be overly critical of someone's work to help them with improving it rather than misleading them by omitting issues at hand. Good luck with the nomination, I will probably revisit later to go through other aspects of the article. Btw, I am prepared to strike my oppose if I decide it's not necessary anymore <a href="User_Till" title="User:Till"><font color="#007BA7"><i><b>Till</b></i></font></a> 11:32, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>Hi Till. Thanks for giving you opinion here. Tbh, I was little worried about "refuses to look back" stuff, so I added in its original form with a reference in the lead. Also, the portrayal of Spears [it's not what the director said but critics commented on it and also Timberlake himself] ... However, I copy-edited the sentence in the lead. I hope it's fine now. Looking forward for other comments before you change your vote [hopefully]. — <span style="text-shadow:#CCC 0.1em 0.3em 0.3em; font-family: Trebuchet MS;font-size: 10pt"><a href="User_Tomica" title="User:Tomica"><font color="#2861B2"><b>Tomíca</b></font></a><a href="User_talk_Tomica" title="User talk:Tomica"><sup><font color="#2861B2">(T2ME)</font></sup></a></span> 11:53, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comments, leaning to support</b>: I carried out a limited peer review (images and lead prose). Having just read the whole article, I think it is in pretty good shape, though I think one more prose pass would be beneficial. I have done a few fixes myself; in addition, here is a list of some relatively minor points I picked up in the first half of the article. I'd like to be reassured that the second half has been checked over, before fully committing to support:</p>
<ul>
<li>"although he adopted the life-long nickname Mac to his friends" - does not real well. Is "Mac" really a "nickname"? For someone called McNeile I'd say it was a diminutive. And does one "adopt" one's own nickname? I think the phrase should be simplified: "...although he was always known by his friends as Mac"
<ul>

</ul>
</li>
<li>"He spent time with a number of Royal Engineer units on the Western Front, including 1st Field Squadron, 15th Field Company and 33rd Division, where he was the commander". What exactly was he commander of? It reads as though you mean the 33rd Division, but divisional commanders were Major-generals, so I assume you don't mean that. As a captain he may have commanded a company. Needs clarification.
<ul>
<li>It's been written in a slightly confusing way ("Commander, Royal Engineers, 33rd Division"), so I've removed the final sub-section regarding commander. - <a href="User_SchroCat" title="User:SchroCat">SchroCat</a> (<a href="User_talk_SchroCat" title="User talk:SchroCat">talk</a>) 21:24, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think the capitalisation in "and was Mentioned in Despatches" is dubious. Outside Wikipedia it is not normally written like this. Note: this usage occurs twice in the paragraph.

<li>I think I ws getting confused by the noun use, and by <a href="Mentioned_in_Despatches" title="Mentioned in Despatches">our own article</a>, which capitalises like there was a glut of caps on the market that needed to be used up. - <a href="User_SchroCat" title="User:SchroCat">SchroCat</a> (<a href="User_talk_SchroCat" title="User talk:SchroCat">talk</a>) 21:24, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Butting in: thanks Brian. Regarding "Mentioned in Despatches", you're quite right ... I haven't seen "proper verbs" outside of military usage (and the occasional trademark; "Xeroxed" was capitalized many years ago), so however common the phrase is with the military, we lowercase it in Milhist articles, or switch to the noun form, "received a Mention in Despatches". - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 20:37, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because Hurricane Carol was a hell of a storm. There's a wicked bad stawm up in New England soon, but Carol was a bad one back in the 50's, in fact one of two storms to hit New England in a two week period in 1954.

<li>"On August 27, Carol intensified to reach winds of 105 mph (169 km/h), but weakened as its motion turned to a northwest drift." -- 169 km/h needs to be rounded. In the second sentence you say it was moving northwest, but in this one you say it turned to the northwest. Confusing.

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because it is a stable good article which has subsequently gone through additional upgrading with both formal and informal peer review. I believe it meets or exceeds the FA criteria. W.R. Brown was a very interesting individual who contributed significantly to the diverse fields of forestry and horse breeding. I have been the lead editor, though with substantial assistance from others, notably User:Churn and change, who helped me with a lot of cleanup and source locating, but has been inactive in recent months. It was passed for GA by none other than Malleus Fatuorum, who also did some copyediting. Thanks also to several other users for extra eyes, copyedits and helpful commentary. I have previously been part of a team on a number of FA article runs, notably for <a href="Appaloosa" title="Appaloosa">Appaloosa</a> and <a href="Yogo_sapphire" title="Yogo sapphire">Yogo sapphire</a>, but this the first time I have taken the lead on a FAC, so please be patient if I have some awkwardness with the procedure. <a href="User_Montanabw" title="User:Montanabw"><font color="#006600">Montanabw</font></a><sup><a href="User_talk_Montanabw" title="User talk:Montanabw">(talk)</a></sup> 00:41, 5 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I'll see if I can do a more elegant fix. Basically, at a peer review, someone wanted a dollars/pounds conversion, but I realized that the conversion rate at the time would not have been the same as now, so I'm open to ways to do this better! --Montanabw
<dl>
<dd>Follow up: I have a version using measuring worth sitting in my sandbox if we need to swap out somthing, it's about 6K different, but it's as of 2010. In my case, I used the WP templates throughout, (<a href="Template_Inflation" title="Template:Inflation">Template:Inflation</a> and layered it into <a href="Template_International_dollars" title="Template:International dollars">Template:International dollars</a> which claim to do all the calculations, which looks like you didn't have to option to do that in 2010, when your article was up. I hope that using the templates makes the calculations work, one of the template cites measuring worth. I could toss the USD calculations if that's the problematic bit. --Montanabw
<dl>
<dd>If I may butt in, my own view is that the {{<a href="Template_Inflation" title="Template:Inflation">inflation</a>}} template is almost always best avoided unless we're talking about fairly recent conversions obviously related to the typical basket of goods, which 20 or so horses clearly isn't. So I've changed the conversion to a historic opportunity cost basis using the <a href="GDP_deflator" title="GDP deflator">GDP deflator</a>, which I think is more realistic. All cited and explained in a note. In general I think that when we provide conversions we should explain the basis for the calculation, another reason to avoid the {{<a href="Template_Inflation" title="Template:Inflation">inflation</a>}} template. <a href="User_George_Ponderevo" title="User:George Ponderevo">George Ponderevo</a> (<a href="User_talk_George_Ponderevo" title="User talk:George Ponderevo">talk</a>) 16:03, 7 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I'm good with that, upon reflection, it sounds like we don't have a good way to actually translate the amount to modern US dollars (or international dollars) either, so I just tossed that bit, though if someone thinks that calculator provides good info, I can restore. The original change came because someone wanted a USD comparison, which appears to be more difficult than I thought. <a href="User_Montanabw" title="User:Montanabw"><font color="#006600">Montanabw</font></a><sup><a href="User_talk_Montanabw" title="User talk:Montanabw">(talk)</a></sup> 23:45, 7 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I don't think it's so difficult; the tricky part is in deciding on what basis to do the inflation calculation. Why not do a conversion from sterling to US dollars for the 2011 equivalent amount of £138,000, which would make it $217,000? That would be about $10,000 a horse, but I've got no idea whether or not that's cheap, which is obviously the point you're trying to make. <a href="User_George_Ponderevo" title="User:George Ponderevo">George Ponderevo</a> (<a href="User_talk_George_Ponderevo" title="User talk:George Ponderevo">talk</a>) 01:15, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Hmm. That's the problem with averages: 10K today for a fine breeding stallion is cheap, but for a good saddle horse or a broodmare is on the high end, other than for top of the line. But Brown WAS after the top of the line. He got one outstanding stallion and a bunch of mares in the deal with Blunt. I ran across a thing (blog, not RS, but I suspect is accurate) that said the price he paid for one of the Egyptian mares was equal to what he paid for the whole lot he got from Blunt,so that helps me some. According to <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.militaryphotos.net/forums/showthread.php?29206-Britain-s-military-use-of-horses-1914-1918">this site</a>, at the end of WWI, an "officer's horse" (i.e. a nice trained saddle horse, probably a gelding) was going for about 75 pounds. 2727 pounds for 20 horses breaks out to about 136 pounds per horse, which is already more than the officer's charger. But I don't know how it ranked in the UK to, say, a champion racehorse or something, which might be the best comparison. In the states, <a href="Man_O'War" title="Man O'War" class="mw-redirect">Man O'War</a>, a stud colt intended as a racehorse, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/seabiscuit-breeding/?flavour=mobile">sold as a yearling for $5000</a> in 1918 dollars, which was also considered a bargain, considering that he became one of the best racehorses of all time. So, do you think we have it accurate, given context?

<dd>Perhaps it would be best just to state the figures without comment, unless you can find a reliable source for that observation about the Egyptian mare, which would really put the price Brown paid for 20 horses into context. <a href="User_George_Ponderevo" title="User:George Ponderevo">George Ponderevo</a> (<a href="User_talk_George_Ponderevo" title="User talk:George Ponderevo">talk</a>) 21:02, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Right now, the text reads " he paid only £2727 for the entire lot." I think it can stand as is, with the "only" being verified in the article citation, and I can find several more sources to verify "only" as a low price in the eyes of Arabian breeder history scholars. I pinged Tigerboy1966 and he pointed me at some racehorse articles where horses, even then,s sold for over a thousand pounds (or guineas, why did they still use guineas in 1918??) each, so by that standard, these horses did sell cheap. I have the basic inflation conversion down in the footnote and as long as you are quite sure we should use opportunity cost and not retail price index (I crunched that in the sandbox and got "This amount would be £104,000 as of 2010, using the retail price index") I'm happy. <a href="User_Montanabw" title="User:Montanabw"><font color="#006600">Montanabw</font></a><sup><a href="User_talk_Montanabw" title="User talk:Montanabw">(talk)</a></sup> 22:43, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because I believe the article now represents a helpful overview of a large topic of wide interest. The 'Camouflage' navbox shows that this article sits in a tree of articles, of which <a href="Military_camouflage" title="Military camouflage">Military camouflage</a> and <a href="Operation_Bertram" title="Operation Bertram">Operation Bertram</a> are also good articles, and others such as <a href="Countershading" title="Countershading">Countershading</a> and <a href="Ship_camouflage" title="Ship camouflage">Ship camouflage</a> are now covered in detail. The function of the 'Camouflage' article itself is thus to provide a concise summary and overview of the whole topic. For this reason it covers a wide range of mechanisms, many with subsidiary articles, and both animal and military camouflage. Where mechanisms may be hard to grasp, they are explained graphically in specially drawn diagrams, such as for 'Eliminating shadow', 'Motion camouflage', and 'Counterillumination'. Since the article is referenced for general interest, it summarizes the historical development of camouflage. It does this both by calling out articles on pioneering books such as those of Abbott Thayer and Hugh Cott, and by summarizing the history of military camouflage. Finally, it provides a wide but carefully chosen set of images, nearly all from Commons, illustrating each aspect of this especially visual topic. <s>It has been found necessary to group the images in galleries to keep them conveniently close to the sections that they illustrate.</s> The bibliography is grouped for easy access by readers with different interests. <a href="User_Chiswick_Chap" title="User:Chiswick Chap">Chiswick Chap</a> (<a href="User_talk_Chiswick_Chap" title="User talk:Chiswick Chap">talk</a>) 09:57, 4 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<li>I don't understand the need for the rather unusual approach taken to images in the article, particularly in the "History" section (since I can't see a reason to depart from regular principles there). Why so many images? We don't have to have pictures of all these people, and it breaks up the flow in my opinion.</li>
</ul>
<p>--- all people images removed; other images have been culled.</p>
<p><s>: Thank you, this does need explaining. The topic is about hiding from view, often in plain sight, so it is necessarily and essentially visual. Accordingly each aspect and mechanism of camouflage is illustrated to show what is done and why. I don't have any special attachment to galleries, so if anyone knows a better way to present the images I'm happy to go with it.</s></p>

<li>It does not make sense to me that there so much content and so many images relating to military camouflage in the <i>Mimesis</i> and <i>Crypsis</i> sections when there is an entire top-level section dedicated to <i>Military</i>. I would think that a much more logical organization would be to strip <i>Mimesis</i> and <i>Crypsis</i> of military content, then place them under a heading called <i>Biology</i> or <i>In nature</i>.
<dl>
<dd>This is because these sections describe principles which apply to anything - living or not - that are to be camouflaged. We would need to refer back to them from the Military section if they were in a Biology section. An alternative would be to have Principles, Biology and Military sections, all three, but then what would we use as examples of Principles? It seems logical to me to explain the principles with real examples, grouping text, diagrams, and photographs together. The military history clearly does not fit into that scheme, which is why it is separate.
<dl>
<dd>As I see it, there are three plausible schemes:
<ul>
<li><i>Principles</i>/<i>Biology</i>/<i>Military</i></li>
<li><i>Biology</i>/<i>Military</i></li>
<li><i>Principles</i>, in which each principle subsection discusses both Biology and Military applications</li>
</ul>
</dd>
<dd>Arguments could be made for all three, but the status quo does not work. It is simply nonsensical to have a top-level <i>Military</i> section without a top-level <i>Biology</i> section. Furthermore, I disagree with the suggestion that the <i>Principles</i>/<i>Biology</i>/<i>Military</i> scheme would make it impossible to give non-redundant examples in the <i>Principles</i> section. You proved it yourself when you made <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Countershading.jpg" title="File:Countershading.jpg">this</a> image. Lastly, I have now realized that the organizational problems affect the <i>History</i> section as well. What criteria are you using to differentiate military material that belongs in the <i>History</i> section versus that which belongs in <i>Development</i>? It seems rather arbitrary to me. (As a side note, I don't mean to suggest that organizing an article like this is easy. It's not. We may never find a "perfect" scheme, but I believe that there are possibilities which are significantly better than that which exists now.) --<b><a href="User_Cryptic_C62" title="User:Cryptic C62">Cryptic C62</a> · <a href="User_talk_Cryptic_C62" title="User talk:Cryptic C62">Talk</a></b> 23:16, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>--- (in work, suggestions welcomed) ... (some hours later) OK, I've rearranged the article as</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>History (with 5 sections, Ancient times ... After 1945), merged from old 'History' and 'Military'; there was indeed some overlap, which I hope is now gone.</dd>
<dd>Principles (Mimesis, Crypsis with 11 sections), with just 3 mil images (actually one's basically a principle drawing), 9 zool images, and 4 diagrams. Hope that feels more balanced.</dd>
<dd>Civil applications (brief), not a great title but 'Phone masts, hunting' doesn't seem too good</dd>
<dd>Fashion, art, society (quite brief too), again could be retitled but it's clear enough</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>--- Have linked <a href="List_of_camouflage_methods" title="List of camouflage methods">List of camouflage methods</a> in a <i>see also</i> at the top of 'Principles': it's a table with examples of each method in land and sea animals, and in military, so this article doesn't have to deal with a lot of images.</p>
<p>--- I believe this works a lot better (and resolves the structural issues) but am too close to it to know.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>I don't see any information about amateur game hunters employing camouflage. This is a fairly obvious application of the concept that is somewhat distinct from military usage.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>--- Thank you, excellent suggestion. New section on non-military camouflage, existing cellphone paragraph and new hunting paragraph.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>I don't see any information about camouflage in fiction. The concept has been explored extensively in science fiction films, books, and video games.</s></li>
</ul>
<p>--- Added an example from science fiction, another from literature. Please let me know if we should have more here; as in fashion, the list could become long.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>The examples given in the <i>19th century origins</i> section highlight that the use of camouflage was unusual at the time, but they don't answer a much more significant question that the reader is likely to have: Was it effective?</s></li>
</ul>
<p>--- There is unsurprisingly little hard evidence. I have added a description and reference to a rare early study by Charles Hamilton Smith in 1800 of the effectiveness of different coloured uniforms.</p>
<ul>
<li><s>The <i>Military</i> section provides plenty of detail on the development of camouflage techniques, and the modern use of camouflaged equipment, but there is essentially no information provided on modern camouflage clothing or the techniques used to create it. I don't see any mention of "digital camouflage".</s></li>
</ul>
<p>--- added paragraph</p>
<ul>
<li>"During the late 1960s and early 1970s in the United States, anti-war protestors often ironically wore military clothing during demonstrations against the American involvement in the Vietnam War." Relevance?

<p><b>Concern</b> I'm seeing some rather fundamental problems with organization and POV of the article. The current texts seems to be quite too heavily dominated by <a href="Military_camouflage" title="Military camouflage">military camouflage</a>. For example, far more than half of the illustrations are of soldiers and military equipment. And this is rather difficult to understand, since there is a perfectly fine stand-alone sub-article for military camouflage. This is most obvious by sections like "Dazzle painting" (obvious military application, but sorted independently), "Fashion, art and society" (inspiration by military) and "Non-military camouflage" (the dead giveaway). <a href="User_Peter_Isotalo" title="User:Peter Isotalo">Peter</a> <sup><a href="User_talk_Peter_Isotalo" title="User talk:Peter Isotalo">Isotalo</a></sup> 21:17, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</p>
<p>--- Thank you. This is an artefact of this FAC, which has removed a large number of animal images; the article was predominantly zoological, balanced by a mil summary (after all, the term camouflage comes from World War I), with no POV to mil. Similarly the title 'non-military...' is of FAC vintage, have replaced it with 'Civil applications'. 'Dazzle' too covers both Zebra and Dazzle ship, not a mil section; retitling to 'Distraction'. Have replaced ship image with zebra, snow overalls with ptarmigan. On the organization question, please see discussion above, which is ongoing.</p>
<p>--- Other images and balance: please see "<b>Reorganisation</b>" above</p>

I don't know how much of a line I have to him directly nowadays (now that he's all "important" and stuff&#160;:) ) but will try to see if I can get him to do so. I don't expect this to hold up any issues on this FAC, since normally game screenshots are not replaceable with free, but this will probably help if I could. --<a href="User_Masem" title="User:Masem">M<font size="-3">ASEM</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Masem" title="User talk:Masem">t</a>) 14:35, 4 February 2013 (UTC)

<li>The gameplay section is a bit confusing to me. I don't get a clear sense of what players do beyond the fact that they're not told much. The thumbnail picture is the only place I learn that there is no HUD, certain details are repeated (<span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #006400;">At the end of the game, the player-controlled spy is killed by an unknown woman after chasing her through the last half of the second level.</span> and <span class="example" style="font-family: Georgia, 'DejaVu Serif', serif; color: #006400;">Finishing the level triggers a set of final sequences of events and the game ends with the sudden death of the player's character.</span>) and plot and gameplay are interwoven in I think a detrimental fashion; it might be better to go over the scant plot details first and then transition to a more fleshed out explanation of what players do. <a href="User_David_Fuchs" title="User:David Fuchs"><font color="#CC6600">Der Wohltemperierte Fuchs</font></a><sup><small>(<a href="User_talk_David_Fuchs" title="User talk:David Fuchs"><font color="#FF6600">talk</font></a>)</small></sup> 01:01, 5 February 2013 (UTC)

<li>What is Game Tunnel and why is it reliable?
<ul>
<li><i>Game Tunnel</i> was a website dedicated to independent games. It had editorial control and oversight, and was founded in 2002 by Russell Carroll. Carroll is a video game developer that worked as Game Director for Reflexive Studios. Website IndieGames covered him (as well as the studio) on <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.indiegames.com/2008/01/interview_gametunnel_owner_rus.html">this interview</a>. Carroll, as wel as the site, Game Tunnel, seemes to be very significant at the indie gaming scece. IndieGames called Game Tunnel's GoTY awards as a "brilliant compendium". He has appeared at several Indie events talkign about development of games and game Tunnel <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gamesetwatch.com/2007/09/independent_games_summit_russell.php">GameSetWatch</a>. Here is more coverage for the website: <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2005/06/prweb254488.htm">PR Web</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cinemablend.com/games/Game-Tunnel-Announces-Indie-Game-Of-The-Year-14313.html">Cinema Blend</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/world-of-goo-wins-game-of-the-year-at-game-tunnel-s-7th-annual-independent-game-of-the-year-awards/058225">World of Goo wins Game of the Year at Game Tunnel's 7th Annual Independent Game of the Year Awards (MCV United Kingdom)</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.mcvuk.com/press-releases/read/aquaria-wins-game-of-the-year-at-game-tunnel-s-6th-annual-independent-games-of-the-year-awards/064346">Aquaria wins Game of the Year at Game Tunnel's 6th Annual Independent Games of the Year Awards (MCV United Kingdom)</a>. Also, the website became a Magazine sometime in 2006, as reported by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.tigsource.com/2006/09/01/game-tunnel-magazine/">TGI Source</a>, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.brokenpencilarchive.tuesdayafternoon.net/view.php?id=4697">Broken Pencil</a>. Game Tunnel's history has even been covered by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2006/12/31/game-tunnel-independent-games-of-the-year/">Joystiq</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/gametunnel-com-rewards-for-supporting-indie-gaming-site-via-kickstarter">GamesIndustry</a>, the latter which named the website "one of the first websites that focused on the indie gaming scene." It was bough by Indie Game Magazine in 2011, as reported by GamesIndustry. I think that this is enough not only to meet reliability but notability.

<li>"Citizen Abel" is not explained anywhere in the article, thus, it is confusing when his name is mentioned later, particularly in the Sequel section where the reader would have to know that the main char of Gravity Bone's name is Citizen Abel in order to understand the significance of the sentence.
<ul>
<li>The main character is not named Citizen Abel. What Citizen Abel is is explained in the Development section: "based on a series of Quake 2 maps entitled Citizen Abel".
<ul>
<li>If that's the case, they you have to explain that in 30 Flights, "Citizen Abel" refers to the main character's name, not a Quake 2 map. <a href="User_Axem_Titanium" title="User:Axem Titanium">Axem Titanium</a> (<a href="User_talk_Axem_Titanium" title="User talk:Axem Titanium">talk</a>) 06:05, 9 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Then yes; I'd have to fix that. The developer of the game, Brendon Chung, said that Citizen Abel is not the name of the character. He also said that the character has no name. I think this is pretty easy to understand from the development section. Also, I see that Masem mistakenly wrote that Citizen Abel was the character on the Sequel section.

<li>Err, Brendon Chung clearly stated on the interview: "It was based on a series of Quake 2 maps I did ten years ago called 'Citizen Abel'." He also stated, when asked if "In Gravity Bone, do you play Citizen Abel, or is that just a reference to your old maps?", that "That doesn't really play a part in the game. You never really see the character, the character never talks, it's just a label I had." With this, it is clear that the character is not named Citizen Abel. — <a href="User_Hahc21" title="User:Hahc21"><font color="#333333"><b>ΛΧΣ</b></font></a><a href="User_talk_Hahc21" title="User talk:Hahc21"><font color="#336699"><b><sup>21</sup></b></font></a> 03:14, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>I visited Biscayne National Park briefly in November 2012, and realized that it had a fascinating history and situation. How many national parks in the US are 95% water, have a nuclear power plant just outside the boundary, are regularly whacked by hurricanes, were pirates' lairs, have four distinct ecosystems, and were the playground of the rich and famous? The version I started with <a class="external autonumber" href="../../w/index-title=Biscayne_National_Park&oldid=520685996.php.html">[3]</a> didn't tell that story. The developed version has been peer-reviewed by Brianboulton, whose comments were encouraging, and I've had the help and advice of MONGO, an experienced writer of FAs on protected areas. I've done a check for copied public-domain material that was once prevalent in these sorts of articles, and I'm confident that none remains. <b><font face="Arial"><a href="User_Acroterion" title="User:Acroterion"><font color="black">Acroterion</font></a> <small><a href="User_talk_Acroterion" title="User talk:Acroterion"><font color="gray">(talk)</font></a></small></font></b> 17:51, 3 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p>Hello kiddies, Joker here, welcome to the last Featured Article nomination of your lives, but as my old pop used to say...if you gotta support one FAC nomination, do it with a smile. At least I think that's what he said, I do prefer to keep my options open after all. Let me tell you allllllllllllll a little story about why you should support this FAC nomination, don't worry about the poison gas or the explosives they're just decorative. Honest. The article as you can clearly see is detailed and fully comprehensive of the material, an oh-so-snug size in terms of prose, uses images effectively and not overzealously, is well-written, and encompasses all available and sourced information, and I do so love sourced information. Reminds me of my first henchman, he was a gas! Or a gun, a knife? Who cares, guy was a loser anyway. Anywayyyy... Oh I can't take all the credit, though I certainly tried, I have to thank <a href="User_Grapple_X" title="User:Grapple X">User:Grapple X</a>, <a href="User_Y2kcrazyjoker4" title="User:Y2kcrazyjoker4">User:Y2kcrazyjoker4</a>, <a href="User_-5-" title="User:-5-">User:-5-</a>, <a href="User_JHunterJ" title="User:JHunterJ">User:JHunterJ</a>, <a href="User_Masem" title="User:Masem">User:Masem</a> and...Cluebot NG?

<dd>I have to disagree on Behind the Voice Actors. The information is not controversial, the site is not user edited and they only add information they can source through contact with the person/their staff/or credits. Sadly the people behind Arkham City thought that having us play a guessing game would be the fun thing to do. I contacted BTVA personally and this is the response I received:</dd>

<dd>I believe it is reliable for this purpose.

<p>Hey, I'm back. Here are some more issues I found. The statement "By the time they had programmed Batman to dive and glide between buildings of the asylum, the adaption of the gameplay to the city was considered natural" doesn't seem to be supported by <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://uk.gamespot.com/special_feature/most-anticipated-2011/day-1/index.html">the source</a>, which says "As soon as we had Batman diving off rooftops and gliding between buildings, we knew that we had made the right decision to take the action to the streets." The claim that the studio "only went forward with [new features] that they felt would be authentic to Batman" doesn't seem to be supported by that source either.

<li>The only difference between "As soon as we had Batman diving off rooftops and gliding between buildings, we knew that we had made the right decision to take the action to the streets." and what is in the article seems to be the word "natural" and "right decision to take action to the streets", I can change "natural" if you want but it, to me at least, seems to be making the same point.</li>
<li>"only went forward with [new features] that they felt would be authentic to Batman" -&gt; in source " The most important thing for us is that players genuinely feel like Batman when they play the game, and so every creative decision that we take is made with that in mind. Then, once we have a feature in place, we ask ourselves, "Does that make me feel like Batman?"</li>

<dd>It should've said Bronze Age of Comics (His outfit from 1970-1985), in the source it calls it 70s Batman, similar to the Preorder source which calls it 1970s Batman. I've replaced the existing source for the preorder with a better one, left the retail one but corrected the Silver Age to Bronze Age. If you think it is unfair to call it Bronze Age if the source doesn't explicitly name it that, let me know and Ill change them both over to just say 1970s Batman, just using Bronze Age because it's searchable what he looked like where 1970s Batman is a bit more broad a term. <a href="User_Darkwarriorblake" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> (<a href="User_talk_Darkwarriorblake" title="User talk:Darkwarriorblake">talk</a>) 22:46, 8 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>This article, like <a href="Operation_Barras" title="Operation Barras">my previous nomination</a>, is the result of a microgrant from Wikimeda UK, who kindly purchased most of the books used in researching these articles. For nearly ten years, the West refused to get involved in the brutal and incredibly bloody civil war in Sierra Leone, until the rebels reneged on a peace agreement that everybody had hoped meant the end of the war. With the UN peacekeeping force on the brink of collapse in May 2000, the United Kingdom sent an entire battalion of paratroopers and its largest naval task force assembled since the Falklands War, setting in motion a chain of events that finally brought the war to an end.</p>
<p>The article has had a successful GA review and MilHist A-class review, and there might be a few relatively minor issues, but I'm reasonably confident that if it isn't quite at FA standard, it's very close. It's a relatively long article (c. 7,000 words), but I hope people will read it and find it interesting.

<dd>Okay. I'm not saying it's not notable enough. It's a great honor. I'm saying it's not necessary for the lead since he's won more than just the BAFTA award. It would sound more impressive to say "and features the music of award winning composer Jeremy Soule" instead of singling out BAFTA. I won't oppose if you don't remove it, that's just my opinion.

<p>Just some minor things all relating to or around the lede.</p>
<ul>
<li>There is no explanation of what <a href="Open_world" title="Open world">open world</a> is for people not educated on video games, making it useless in the opening sentence and open world isn't a genre. Recommend removing it from there and moving the link to the first instance of "Open World" in the second paragraph where the explanation is present.</li>
<li>Also the extensive listing of release dates in the opening prose makes it look messy and is unnecessary, we have the infobox for that, we don't need to know that the PC version, released in 2006, was released through STEAM in 2009, it's not a console its a delivery method, Stick to the earliest release date of different formats</li>
<li>JP release dates don't belong in the infobox unless its a Japanese game or the release there is in someway notable</li>
<li>There is a mobile release date listed, but I assume this is not strictly the same game but some kind of adaptation? There is no mention of it at all in the article, but while I'm not super up on my phones, I can't imagine it is hte same game. If it is not the game as released on the other platforms then it probably doesn't belong in the infobox about that base game, and should be discussed in the prose either way.</li>
<li>Not a major thing and maybe someone else will think different, but similar to above issue, not sure why the Game of the Year release date needs listing in the infobox, its just a re-release of the base game with post-release content, and there are two separate large Game of the Year listings for two different formats.</li>
<li>The rest seems OK. <a href="User_Darkwarriorblake" title="User:Darkwarriorblake">Darkwarriorblake</a> (<a href="User_talk_Darkwarriorblake" title="User talk:Darkwarriorblake">talk</a>) 18:34, 31 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>"Oblivion was well received" by who? Be a little more specific, Like "Oblivion was critically acclaimed, achievign a score of 94 at Metacritic" or something.</li>
<li>I think that mentioning how much copies it shipped in 2006 to then add a newer statistic is a bit of not needed. if I were you, I'd only stick with the 3.5m number on the lead.</li>

<ul>
<li>"The Emperor and the Blades head to a sewer that leads out of the city, using a secret entrance that is located in the player's cell." The next sentence doesn't make much sense if you don't state here that the prisoner (a.k.a. the player) was taken with them to the sewers. (Yes, I played the game XD)</li>
<li>"the group, joined by the player" I think that if you state (on the previous sentence) that the player followed then, you can avoid saying "joined by the player" here.</li>

<li>A few <b>comments</b> on the lead prose:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>" After Brazilian independence in 1822, Inhaúma enlisted to serve in the armada (navy) of Brazil." Is it right, in this context, to refer to him as "Inhaúma", when he did not acquire this title until 1867? The same applies to other statements in the lead. I note that in the article itself you call him "Joaquim Inácio" until his title is conferred.</li>
<li>"enlisted to serve..." The words "to serve" are redundant.</li>
<li>"during the latter half of the 1820s, he engaged in subduing secessionist rebellions". As worded, this suggests a major role which, in view of his youth, is unlikely. Suggest you soften to "participated in the subduing of..." or similar</li>
<li>"during that troubled period". In the interests of neutrality I would remove "troubled".</li>
<li>"He first saw action in the Sabinada between 1837 and 1838..." This will confuse readers, who have just been told he put down rebellions in the late 1820s, which is presumably where he first saw action.</li>
<li>"a couple years" is colloquial American English. It is not encyclopedic.</li>
<li>I am somewhat puzzled by the fourth paragraph, which summarises Inhaúma as hesitant, procrastinating, mentally exhausted and diseased, yet then says he is regarded as among the greatest Brazilian navy officers. Perhaps, rather than making so definitive a statement ("Inhaúma's leadership was encumbered by his hesitating and procrastinating behavior") you should qualify this, e.g. "some historians believe that..." etc.</li>

<dd>Hi, Brian. It's good to see you. Now let's take a look at your comment:
<ol>
<li>He is called Inhaúma in the entire text of the lead for simplicity's sake. It's the same standard used in other similar articles such as <a href="Pedro_II_of_Brazil" title="Pedro II of Brazil">Pedro II of Brazil</a>, <a href="Lu%C3%ADs_Alves_de_Lima_e_Silva,_Duke_of_Caxias" title="Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias">Luís Alves de Lima e Silva, Duke of Caxias</a>, <a href="Manuel_Marques_de_Sousa,_Count_of_Porto_Alegre" title="Manuel Marques de Sousa, Count of Porto Alegre">Manuel Marques de Sousa, Count of Porto Alegre</a>, etc...</li>
<li>"<i>enlisted to serve...</i>" Fixed that.</li>
<li>"<i>during the latter half of the 1820s, he engaged in subduing secessionist rebellions</i>". Fixed as per your suggestion.</li>
<li>"during that troubled period". It was a troubled time the regency in the 1830s. It was regarded as such by contemporaries and historians. Don't worry, it isn't a controversial issue. In fact, nothing in the article or related to it it's controversial.</li>
<li>"<i>He first saw action in the Sabinada between 1837 and 1838</i>..." Fixed that by removing "first".</li>
<li>"<i>a couple years</i>" Changed for "two".</li>
<li>"<i>I am somewhat puzzled by the fourth paragraph, which summarises Inhaúma as hesitant</i>..." Merely because he was a brave officer and regarded by a few historians as one of the greatest in Brazilian history doesn't mean that he was devoid of flaws, right? And that is also uncontroversial. Even his superior, the Duke of Caxias complained about his behavior.</li>

<li>Hi, Joe, it's good to see you. The reason to why I used "PD-100" was because I compared with the lifetime of contemporary Brazilian photographers: <a href="Revert_Henrique_Klumb" title="Revert Henrique Klumb">Revert Henrique Klumb</a> (183? — c. 1886), <a href="Alberto_Henschel" title="Alberto Henschel">Alberto Henschel</a> (1827-1882), <a href="Augusto_Stahl" title="Augusto Stahl">Augusto Stahl</a> (1828-1877), etc... all active in the 1860s. <a href="Marc_Ferrez" title="Marc Ferrez">Marc Ferrez</a> (1843-1923), who was active in the 1880s lived until 1923. I can hardly believe that the photographer who took those photos lived until the 1890s, even less the 1910s. In the specific case of the Viscount of Inhaúma, photographs and lithographys portraying him became common in the 1860s until his death in 1869 after he became Minister of Navy and commanded the Brazilian navy in the <a href="Paraguayan_War" title="Paraguayan War">Paraguayan War</a> (1864-70). Photos were sold nationwide (just like in the U.S. with Grant and Lee, for example), litographs were published in newspapers, etc... There are no known portraits of Inhaúma after his death. I added a few words to a couple of captions. I'm out of ideas here. If you have any suggestions I'd appreciate.

<p>I am nominating this short article for featured article because I feel that it meets all of the criteria. The article covers every source I can find on the subject. The only known exception is his burial record at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://public.mapper.army.mil/ANC/ANCWeb/PublicWMV/ancWeb.html">Arlington National Cemetery</a>, which would provide an interment date and grave location (section &amp; tombstone number). I will include the information if someone can suggest a proper citation, especially since I cannot link directly to the record, only to the database. (An image of the tombstone may also be in the public domain under PD-USGov, but I'm not certain and cannot get a response from Arlington National Cemetery.) Assistance on these two issues would be most welcome. If any other sources can be located, please send them to me and I will quickly incorporate them.</p>
<p>Lyon was not known for a single, major contribution to the sciences, but contributed about 160&#160;papers over the course of his career. He named two of the slow loris species that were recently elevated to species status, and is the authority on several genera and species of mammals (including a ton of synonyms). In all, this should be a complete, short article about a lesser known naturalist from the early 1900s. <span style="text-shadow:grey 0.1em 0.1em 0.3em; font-family: fantasy, cursive, Serif"><b>–&#160;<a href="User_Maky" title="User:Maky"><font color="darkgreen">Maky</font></a> <sup>«<a href="User_talk_Maky" title="User talk:Maky"><font color="olive">&#160;talk&#160;</font></a>»</sup></b></span> 16:02, 23 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Thanks for the source and image review. Fixes made as requested... Lol! Living in Atlanta, I don't have access to the Notre Dame library, and I'm not even sure how I would cite family papers if I could get them to send me digital copies. What kind of information would you like to get from them?

In the <a class="external text" href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates/God_of_War_(video_game)/archive1">last nomination</a> (also check the Talk page as some comments were moved there), the article received 3 supports and 1 oppose. The opposition was based on prose of the article (as that reviewer is not a "gamer" and some language she did not understand). In her last comment, she said the article was close. I'm hoping that the work that has been done since that comment has appeased her last comment (the nomination was closed before she could respond and she hasn't responded to a request to post on the article's Talk page). <a href="User_JDC808" title="User:JDC808"><font color="green">JDC808</font></a> <a href="User_talk_JDC808" title="User talk:JDC808"><font color="black">♫</font></a> 23:37, 21 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p>This is in the second para of the lead. Without reading the article, I can't tell who the "who is responsible" refers to. Is Ares responsible for Kratos murdering his family? Without reading the article, that confuses. After reading the article, I understand, but many people will read only the lead. The sentence needs more clarity.</p>

<p><b>Oppose</b> on prose and comprehensiveness issues. The article is obviously and naturally written by editors who are intimately familiar with the game.

<dd>"Kratos can learn to use up to four magical abilities, such as Zeus' Fury that allows him to throw lightning bolts, giving him a variety of ways to attack and kill enemies." I kind of assumed that throwing lightning bolts was so the player could attack enemies, but why would I want to throw a lighting bolt instead of just whacking the monster with my Blades of Chaos? Do they have better range? Stronger hits? Greater chances of a knockout? Better/gorier graphics and sound effects? Faster attacks? That's what I was looking for. Same with the Blade of Artemis. It's a different weapon, but does it have some advantages in certain situations over the Blades of Chaos? Are both weapons armed at the same time? I'm kind of curious how Kratos is able to wield a sword when he has chains welded to his wrists, but I don't think that matters in the article. <a href="User_Neil916" title="User:Neil916">Neil916</a> (<a href="User_talk_Neil916" title="User talk:Neil916">Talk</a>) 11:13, 1 February 2013 (UTC)

When the article says that the quick time events that require the successful completion game controller actions, I think it means that a successful completion of a particular QTE requires a successful execution of a timed sequence, but it might also mean that certain QTE sequences are required to be completed successfully in order to complete the game.

A second prequel is in development." I still have some problems with these two sentences. First, I think they're far off topic in a paragraph where the other three sentences discuss elements of the game's gameplay. Second, I don't quite get the wording. It is the first installment, but the third chronologically, there are four sequels and a prequel as of 2012. Until the second prequel that is in development is actually released, I think that makes this the second cronologically. The information is important enough to include in the lead, but it's misplaced and confusingly worded as it is.

<p><b>Book referencing</b></p>
<p>There appears to be multiple citations from the "God of War (Instruction manual)" and the book by Stover and Vardeman. The pattern used in the article appears to be that the first citation is stated in the form "SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed. (2005). God of War (Instruction manual). Sony Computer Entertainment. pp. 16-17." while the following are in the form " SCE Santa Monica Studio, ed. (2005), pp. 18–19". I'm not sure if this is the proper way to cite books.

<dd>On this point, Futuretrillionaire, are you saying all the references, including the first one, should be short, with a separate full citation that is not individually referenced, but is pointed to by all the short ones? Check the way the manual is referenced in <i><a href="God_of_War__Chains_of_Olympus" title="God of War: Chains of Olympus">God of War: Chains of Olympus</a></i>, which is the same as here, versus <i><a href="Starflight" title="Starflight">Starflight</a></i>, which I think has what you want? —<b><a href="User_Torchiest" title="User:Torchiest">Torchiest</a></b> <sup><a href="User_talk_Torchiest" title="User talk:Torchiest">talk</a></sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;"><a href="Special_Contributions/Torchiest" title="Special:Contributions/Torchiest">edits</a></sub> 05:18, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I think the Starflight model is better. I'd like to see in addition to the "references" section a "bibliography" section, where we put the full citation of books without the page numbers.

<dd>Paul Eiding is listed at allgame, they typoed his name as Oaul Eiding, same with Carole Ruggier, should be "ier" not "ler". And yes, he is listed in the manual.

<dd>Interesting, I think you're right. I checked several other featured VG articles, and some of them do not have citations, and some of the ones that do use primary sources (the game itself).

<dd>Yeah. I think the main reason is that unless you cite the game itself, you'd have to use a strategy and unless you own it, you'd have to find one online that can't be edited freely.

<dd>Actually, according to <a href="Wikipedia_WikiProject_Video_games/Sources#Video_games" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Sources">Wikipedia:WikiProject Video games/Sources#Video games</a>, when citing the VG itself, we need to "provide transcripts wherever possible, and enable readers to check the facts themselves by noting which area, level or episode is cited." This seems to imply that we need to add citations for parts relying on primary sources.

<dd>I have to reply to this item: '"The goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the God of War for which the game is named and who is responsible for Kratos' accidental killing of his family." – why is "for which the game is named" necessary? It's obvious (and should be "after whom").'</dd>
<dd>That sentence has been changed a few times now. The version before the current one said, "The goddess Athena tasks Kratos with killing Ares, the eponymous God of War, who is responsible for Kratos' accidental killing of his family." An editor did not like the word <i>eponymous</i>, finding it too obscure, so the longer phrase was added to explicate the definition. Before that, the sentence said, "Kratos is tasked by the goddess Athena with killing Ares, the God of War, who is responsible for Kratos' accidental murder of his family." An editor did not like the sentence structure, finding the apposition confused how many people were being referred to in the sentence. That was corrected with an active voice and the addition of <i>eponymous</i> to make it clear that "Ares" and "the God of War" are the same person. So I would submit that things that some readers find obvious need more explanation for other editors. I'm certain many readers would not recognize the name Ares. —<b><a href="User_Torchiest" title="User:Torchiest">Torchiest</a></b> <sup><a href="User_talk_Torchiest" title="User talk:Torchiest">talk</a></sup><sub style="margin-left:-3ex;"><a href="Special_Contributions/Torchiest" title="Special:Contributions/Torchiest">edits</a></sub> 05:00, 28 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Thank you. I think with the current wording it is clear who Ares is, but I guess we can use dashes or parentheses to make it even clearer. Yes, I think <i>eponymous</i> is a bit odd, but it is also clear that <i>God of War</i> is named after the God of War without having to mention that.

<li>"God of War is a third person action-adventure video game published by Sony Computer Entertainment (SCE) and developed by SCE Santa Monica Studio."—I'd preferably write by whom it was developed before by whom it was published.

<dd>I agree. The reason it's written that way is because SandyGeorgia had suggested it because of the "SCE" acronym.

<li><b>Regretful note</b>: I'm not sure what to say. This is my third pass through the article, and it still does not have the brilliant and professional prose it should. It's not far, but the language still does not flow well. There's a bit of clumsy and ungainly wording, some odd flow, and some grammatical inconsistencies. The prose also does not seem naturally written to me. These are altogether making me reluctant to support this nomination. Yes, prose reviewing can a subjective process, but it's hard to approve of a FAC you can't read without finding odd bumps along the way. My final piece of advice is for you to try to find a copy editor who is unfamiliar with the article and its topic, and kindly get them to run an eye over the prose. But with that said, it has been a pleasure reviewing this article. I've learned a lot about this fine game's history (haven't played it a lot, though) and appreciate your cooperation JDC808. I'm not sure how this FAC will turn out (you have plenty of support it seems, but a couple of opposes) but wish you good luck for the best. —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 20:54, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating this for featured article status because I have recently undertaken a lot of work to improve it and pull it up to what I hope is FA quality; but I leave others to be the judge of that. Because it deals with a relatively minor, obscure subject, I have been able to use all of the academic, peer-reviewed publications that have ever been published on this issue in order to put together this article. I therefore consider it to be as comprehensive as possible, and can see little space for improvement. <a href="User_Midnightblueowl" title="User:Midnightblueowl">Midnightblueowl</a> (<a href="User_talk_Midnightblueowl" title="User talk:Midnightblueowl">talk</a>) 14:35, 21 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Apologies, an editor had moved the cited sources into the Further Reading after I had initiated this FA nomination; I have corrected this. I have also corrected Heselton to 2004. Field is a newspaper article, long out of print, so I am unsure that we would be able to obtain the page number in this instance, although I shall look into it. Similar problem with Wilson, in that the article is in an obscure and long out of print magazine, but I shall look into it <a href="User_Midnightblueowl" title="User:Midnightblueowl">Midnightblueowl</a> (<a href="User_talk_Midnightblueowl" title="User talk:Midnightblueowl">talk</a>) 00:29, 25 January 2013 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b> The article should be titled <a href="Etymology_of_Wicca" title="Etymology of Wicca">Etymology of Wicca</a>. The current name implies that there is a type of etymology known as Wicca. This is a subarticle of <a href="Wicca" title="Wicca">Wicca</a>, and you do not also have 'Wicca (history)', but rather 'History of Wicca', and the sames goes for this one. <a href="User_Reywas92" title="User:Reywas92"><font color="#1EC112"><span style="text-shadow:grey 0.3em 0.3em 0.1em; class=texhtml">Reywas92</span></font></a><sup><a href="User_talk_Reywas92" title="User talk:Reywas92"><font color="#45E03A"><b>Talk</b></font></a></sup> 16:33, 3 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>That's an interesting point that you have made Reywas92.

However, would a better title be <a href="../../w/index-title=Etymology_of_%22Wicca%22&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Etymology of &quot;Wicca&quot; (page does not exist)">Etymology of "Wicca"</a>, reflecting that the article deals with the word itself, not the religious movement that it refers to&#160;? <a href="User_Midnightblueowl" title="User:Midnightblueowl">Midnightblueowl</a> (<a href="User_talk_Midnightblueowl" title="User talk:Midnightblueowl">talk</a>) 17:40, 3 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Hm, that article probably ought to be moved too.

In July 2008, the article reached a <a href="Wikipedia_GA" title="Wikipedia:GA" class="mw-redirect">GA status</a>, and subsequently went on to have an unsuccessful FAC.

<p><b>Quick comments</b></p>
<p>TIs is mostly mostly very good, but a few quibbles.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rs. 840 million—please use lakhs and crores, else Indians like me will need to do some mental math to understand. Non-Indians have the millions of dollars right next to it anyway.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Done</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>since we have <a class="external text" href="http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Kareena_Kapoor">an abundance</a> of free photos, why not use more? Around one for every sub-section would be nice. Try to add relevant captions, like about her "trademark" lips in Pubic image section.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, adding "around one [image] for every sub-section" would unnecessarily increase the size of the article; I've only added images that help contribute to the article in some way. For example, the image of Kapoor with her mother and sister in the "Early life and background" section shows that the two women have played pivotal roles in her life. And this has been confirmed by Kapoor in several of her interviews. (I've added a new image in the "Public image and character" section discussing her trademark lips.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>surprised there's no mention of her size zero and the ensuing controversy.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>There wasn't really a so-called "controversy" about size zero. A lot was written about it by the media but other than that nothing much. Maybe we could say something like: "Kapoor's off-screen life has been subject to wide media coverage in India with frequent press coverage of her weight and diet."</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"would show more a more thoughtful"—huh?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>I took that from the source without realizing the mistake they made. Fixed it.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>golden-hearted prostitute—I've heard of a hooker with a heart of gold, but is golden-hearted prostitute a common/acceptable phrase?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The description of her character in <i>Chameli</i> is taken from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.sify.com/movies/playing-the-golden-hearted-prostitute-news-bollywood-kkfvNUhijei.html">here</a>; it is pretty much the same thing as "hooker with a heart of gold".</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>subject of considerable critical analysis—source doesn't back this, and only talks of intense tabloid interest.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>The source states: "While her choice of movies continues to range from interesting to objectionable, Kareena has mastered the art of balancing blockbusters with bloopers". In a way, it is critically analysed, but I'll try finding another source. (A new source was added as well as another one which already exists within the article.)</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>total film count? Worth adding in the lead?</li>
<li>over linking—villain, leading lady, Bangladeshi, Netherlands etc. please review throughout, and just these.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>IMO, I really don't think we need to add her total film count; the same might apply to the over linking part. I agree that some of the terms like 'leading lady' or 'villain' do not need to be linked but others like 'Netherlands', etc do.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Stage performances is just a smorgasbord of actors' names. I suggest removing all and replacing them with a "performing with several Bollywood contemporaries" to the first sentence.<a href="../Special_Contributions/122.172.14.75" title="Special:Contributions/122.172.14.75">122.172.14.75</a> (<a href="../../w/index-title=User_talk_122.172.14.75&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="User talk:122.172.14.75 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:46, 21 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>We can't always say "performing with several Bollywood contemporaries"; it might get a bit too repetitive. As you can see that the section combines both (listing actors' names as well as several Bollywood stars).

<ul>
<li>In the lead, <i>Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham</i> is mentioned as her "greatest" commercial success to date. I don't think "greatest" is the right word to use. Also, I don't see the point of mentioning that, because it was neither her first commercial success nor her biggest.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Tweaked. I agree that K3G wasn't her "first commercial success" but the reason why it is mentioned is because it was her first "worldwide" success. Also, prior to 3I, K3G was still her biggest success to date.</dd>

<li>The quote in the second line of the career section, "it was probably destined that I was not to be in the film. After all, it was a launch for his son. The whole focus was on the boy.

<li>I see very many hacked up modified quotes. For example:</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"were never officially divorced ... [but] ... liv[ed] separately."</dd>
<dd>"[I]n the best performance of her career so far, [Kapoor] leads Mahi's character through the murky labyrinth of ambition, rivalry and self-destructive tricks of survival in the rat race. Though her character is inconsistent [she] furnishes ... [it] with a rare vulnerability and an exceptional inner life"
<dl>
<dd>I think the second one is missing some ... before the [she], but why do this as opposed to either paraphrasing or quoting directly? It may look to the reader that you are trying to bend the quotes to your liking.
<dl>
<dd>One of the main reasons why I "hacked up" quotes was because they were too long. I've made some adjustments (1st quote: Removing the modifications and sourcing it like a regular sentence; 2nd quote: Paraphrasing it and only quoting the last part.)

<ul>
<li>"Kapoor was initially cast to make her debut" ... doesn't sound too encyclopedic. Also, the quote (as mentioned in the previous set of comments) still doesn't sound interesting. Maybe paraphrasing would help.</li>

<p><b>Comment on footnote style</b> <s>There are discrepancies. I see in some newspaper sources, you have mentioned the name of the publisher, while in others you have not. The name of publisher should be present either in all newspaper footnotes, or none (obviously mentioning in none is the easier option). Rediff.com, a website, has not been italicised, but indiatimes, another website, has been italicised (I think most of the websites are not in italics, which is a god style to follow consistently). CNN-IBN, a V channel, should not be italicised. I think Mid Day name should not use the particular style (MiD DAY) of its logo, just mention as Mid Day.--<a href="User_Dwaipayanc" title="User:Dwaipayanc">Dwaipayan</a> (<a href="User_talk_Dwaipayanc" title="User talk:Dwaipayanc">talk</a>) 04:05, 24 January 2013 (UTC)</s></p>

<dd>If lets say an actor/actress retired, then sometime after their retirement, they receive a lifetime achievement award or something of similar honor.

<dd>Reply to your second point: IMO, details for all these stage shows are not trivial; <i>all</i> of the shows specifically mention where they took place similar to that of Zinta's article. As far as mentioning the shows that took place in India, the "stage performances" section is intended just for her world tours/shows that took place abroad.

<dd>That is because K3G was her <i>first worldwide success</i>.

<dd>I just don't know what to say. Barring the one from OneIndia and to some extent NDTV, the other three are positive. As I said for the analysis of films, which pretty much can be applied to the analysis of her critical reviews, <i>some</i> mixed reviews doesn't mean that the overall reception was "mixed".

<li>Her Performance and analysis says ...Despite the least success rate among her contemporaries....[...], I see a complete reversed version as all her hits here, are tagged with "one of the years biggest hits or success". Why it is important to say "one of the years biggest". Can't you use "was a box office success", "major success". Use "one of....." only in the major success's like Golmaal 3.</li>

<dt>Some comments inpite of earlier support</dt>
<dd>Again, the article sounds like a too much for FA.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>After making her acting debut in the 2000 war drama Refugee, Kapoor's early years in the film industry were successful; she received a Filmfare nomination for Asoka: But the below section of initial years says her initial years were average. Lots of failures and few or 2-3 success. Do this shows her sussess?</li>
<li>Getting a nomination at filmfare is what&#160;? She only got this nomination and it doesn't make any thing a success.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>If you would you have cared to read the rest of the sentence then you would know what I'm talking about. It later says that "this was followed by a series of commercial failures and repetitive roles, which garnered her negative reviews." By early years, I meant 2001; if you take a look at the sources from <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://boxofficeindia.com/cpages.php?pageName=top_actress">BOI</a> and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.rediff.com/entertai/2001/dec/29heroin.htm">Rediff.com</a>, you can see that the statement is correct. As far as the Filmfare nomination is concerned, the reason why I mentioned it was because it was her <i>first</i> nomination for <i>Best Actress</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Again, the positive reviews for Asoka are giving me a nightmare. The Indian reviews says that the film was worst of the year. I think rotten tomatoes just shows average of foreign reviews.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Please show me the reviews that say "the film was worst of the year". We can see that all the foreign reviews were positive whereas the ones from Indian film critics were mixed. For that reason I used the word <i>generally</i>.</dd>
</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Although a poll (conducted by Bollywood Hungama) named it the most anticipated release of the year,[48] the film was a commercial and critical failure. Why this is important to mention. Reality is Tashan is a critical and commercial disasters. Every third film with multistar cast attracts viewers interest but most important is the results which is Disaster.</li>

Also, my feeling is that most readers don't know how to interpret phonetic symbology, even though it looks fancy and scholarly.

<li>The sentence in paragraph two "The name "Coke" itself was pronounced "kuke" during the..." should be moved to the previous paragraph, since this is where you are discussing the family name, and that is a more suitable place to discuss the pronunciation. As for the pronunciation, "kuke" to me would be pronounced as in the word "cuckoo". This may be an Americanism, but the word "cuke", which is short for cucumber, would be more suitable. Is this not used by the English? If this doesn't work, then you could say it begins like the word "queue".

<li>"by the age of 18 the students have learnt" Is "learnt" proper English? My American spell checker balks at the word. Is the word "endight" the correct word, and not "enlight"? If it is a valid word, could it be linked to wictionary? I haven't seen the word before.
<dl>
<dd>Learnt is acceptable over here, at least (I am informed it is the "past participle, past tense of learn (Verb)"). On endight, I've done a bit of etymological searching (after verifying that it's not a typo on my part).

<p><i>Politics</i></p>
<ul>
<li>Opening paragraph: the word "secured" used twice in one sentence. Perhaps change one to "obtained". Also, I'm accustomed to "on their behalf" instead of "in their behalf" but don't know the customary way to say it in England. The construction "was returned for Aldeburgh" doesn't make sense to me. Do you mean "returned to Aldeburgh"?</li>

<p><i>Attorney General</i></p>
<ul>
<li>"The charges were never brought, as on 8&#160;February&#160;1601 Devereux ordered his followers to meet at Essex House" doesn't make sense. What do Devereaux's actions have to do with the charges not being made? I think you need to say something like: "The charges were never brought because of an incident that soon transpired. Devereaux ordered his followers to meet at Essex House on 8&#160;February&#160;1601, but when emissaries led by <a href="Thomas_Egerton,_1st_Viscount_Brackley" title="Thomas Egerton, 1st Viscount Brackley">Thomas Egerton</a> and <a href="John_Popham_(Lord_Chief_Justice)" title="John Popham (Lord Chief Justice)">John Popham</a> were sent to him the following day, they were taken hostage."</li>

<p><i>Monopolies</i></p>

<li>"his desire to complete his writings and advanced age" to complete his advanced age? To avoid possible confusion or stumbling by the reader, I recommend: "his desire to complete his writings coupled with his advanced age..."</li>

<ul>
<li>"Coke was still in good health, despite his advanced age, and took daily exercise." "advanced" is redundant. Recommend: "Despite his age, Coke remained in good health, and exercised daily."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"As he was on his deathbed the Privy Council ordered that his house and chambers be searched, seizing 50&#160;manuscripts, which were later restored – his will, however, was permanently lost" Recommend: "While he was on his deathbed the Privy Council had his house and chambers searched, seizing... which were later restored, though his will was permanently lost."</li>

<ul>
<li>first image in this section does not have alt text.</li>

<li>"Paston was noted by Woolrych as an "incomparable" woman..." Since much attention is given to the father named Paston, I would call her "Bridget" and not "Paston" in this sentence, to avoid confusion, because I immediately thought you were talking about the father, not the daughter.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"After Bridget Paston died in 1598..." Recommend "Following the death of his first wife in 1598, Coke married..."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Despite the marriage Coke was not buried next to Hatton, but instead next to Bridget Paston, who his daughter Anne declared was Coke's "first and best wife" " Recommend: "Coke was buried beside his first wife, who was called his "first and best wife" by his daughter Anne." You don't need to qualify this with "Despite the marriage..." because it is not unusual for a person who remarries to be buried beside their first spouse, particularly if that spouse is the parent of most of the children.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Hatton and Coke had two children, both daughters..." Recommend: "Coke had two children with his second wife, both daughters,..."</li>
</ul>
<p><i>Reports</i></p>
<ul>
<li>"during his career, Coke would note down earlier cases he had heard of..." "note down" is awkward. Recommend either "jot down" or else "Coke took note of earlier cases..." Ditto in the next sentence.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"Although lent to friends and family, and therefore in slight public circulation, Coke never formally published his entire <i>Reports</i> during his lifetime" Coke wasn't loaned to friends and family. This should read "Although loaned to friends and family, and ..., Coke's <i>Reports</i> were never formally published during his lifetime."</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>"In July&#160;1634, officials acting on order of the King had seized Coke's papers, and between then and a 1641 motion in the House of Commons restoring those papers that could be found to Coke's eldest son,..." This doesn't make sense; break up into two sentences for coherence.</li>
</ul>

<li>Was John Selden introduced? I don't recall.</li>

<ul>
<li>While this isn't a show stopper, I was disappointed to find no mention about Coke's influence on <a href="Roger_Williams_(theologian)" title="Roger Williams (theologian)">Roger Williams</a> in this substantial article. Since Williams was mentored by Coke, and then became one of the great religious figures in American history, this is really a pretty big deal. A recent book (2012) on Williams discusses the relationship between the two men, though I have not yet read the book. A commentary by the author concerning a review in the NY Times can be found <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/22/books/review/roger-williams.html?_r=0">here</a>.</li>

<p><b>Comments from Wehwalt</b></p>
<p>Quite good and engaging, but I have my usual list of quibbles:</p>
<p><br /></p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>Lede</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Consider including in parentheses the alternate name of the <i>ex officio</i> oath, simply because the Star Chamber is well-known.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Family background</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"The name "Coke" itself ..." Consider putting this sentence in a footnote.</dd>
<dd>"something that later served Edward well" Perhaps "a connection that later served Edward well"&#160;? It's not quite certain whether the something is the connection to the Earl, or the marriage.</dd>
<dd>" and daughters second" I'd cut this as unneeded.</dd>
<dd>"Winifred remarried to Robert Bozoun" Which Winifred?</dd>
<dd>"A property trader, Bozoun ..." this sentence gets between the influence and the evidence thereof, and I suggest it be moved slightly. Perhaps, "Robert Bozoun, a property trader and a member of an old family. Noted for his piety and strong business acumen (he had once forced Nicholas Bacon to pay an exorbitant amount for a piece of property), Bozoun had a tremendous influence on the Coke children." You could even consider cutting the new parenthetical ...</dd>
<dd>"little is known" Three times in three sentences. I suggest you vary one phrase diversely.</dd>
<dd>"the Inns of Chancery, including Clifford's Inn, served as a place of initial legal education" On balance, I think a plural form is better ("a place") although granted, I can see a case for the other. Consider rephrasing to avoid.</dd>
<dd>"other pieces of high culture at the Inns" This sounds a bit odd to me, but perhaps it is just me.</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Practice as a barrister</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>If he began is practice immediately in 1578, how was it his first case was not until 1581?</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"forcing them to start the case anew.[38] Cromwell brought the case again, " a bit repetitive.</li>
<li>"paid off any royal clerks" Paid off? As in bribed?</li>
<li>"see off" seems a bit informal. Perhaps "oppose" or "defeat"?</li>
<li>Why the Third Duke but the 4th Duke? And a link to the treacherous one?</li>
<li>" his third was Slade's Case," His third what? Famous case?</li>
<li>"Coke's argument in the case formed the first definition of consideration." Wouldn't it have been the judgment, which presumably incorporated his argument?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Politics</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Coke had earned the favour of the Dukes of Norfolk ... With their support, " Were there several Dukes of Norfolk at a time?</li>
<li>"and thanks to the influence of the Cecil family" As this is the first you've mentioned them, it's not clear why they should exert themselves on behalf of Coke.</li>
<li>"Although confirmed on 28 January 1593, he did not take up his post until the state opening of Parliament on 19 February 1593, a position he held at the same time as that of Solicitor General." Problem with this sentence.</li>
<li>"The idea of a peaceful, swift Parliament" given that the purpose was to impose taxes for war, "peaceful"'s a bit jarring. Quiet?</li>
<li>"due to religious problems." Perhaps, "due to religious conflict"?</li>
<li>"as Speaker of the House of Commons (whose job was to introduce any bills)" If his job was to introduce bills, how is it the bills which caused all the trouble were introduced?</li>
<li>"a day of respite". Perhaps "a day's delay"?</li>
<li>"opened up" somewhat informal phrases such as this are slightly jarring, perhaps because of the 16th century subject matter.</li>
<li>" A day later a group of emissaries led by Thomas Egerton and John Popham were sent to him and taken hostage." Huh?</li>
<li>The material concerning Devereaux perhaps can be cut a bit?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>James I</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>The phrasing used implies there was doubt that James would be able to successfully claim the throne, but this isn't backed up in the article.</li>
<li>"the new royals." Surely James was royal from birth?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Judicial work</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>" known as Fuller's Case after the defending barrister, Nicholas Fuller." This can be read to say that the case was named after the barrister who had the defense in it.</li>
<li>"Coke's first case of note was Peacham's Case" I'd insert a "there" somewhere in this phrase.</li>
<li>" which saw the King's actions as him tampering with justice." I would omit "him"</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Return to politics</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>James's action in ordering Coke's re-election seems so surprising (especially in light of subsequent events) that it almost begs for further explanation as to motivation.</li>
<li>Again with the link to Cecil! And title! I think he appears often enough that he need only be linked on first appearance</li>
<li>I would mention the term "letters patent" much higher in the paragraph. People may think of "patents" in a rather different sense.</li>
<li>You seem to me to be inconsistent in your capitalisation of "crown".</li>
<li>" Coke was briefly restrained from acting in Parliament by Charles;" I would cut this phrase, it is implied in the rest of the sentence.</li>
<li>"the person, for all others are accessory to it" I don't see how this fits the rest of the quoted matter.</li>
<li>"eventually rejected the Resolutions formally" I would boil this down to "rejected the Resolutions"</li>
<li>"Coke then undertook the central role" Strike "then" I would, especially since the last action was Charles' rejection</li>
<li>"The resulting debate led to some MPs being unable to speak due to their tears, fearing that the King was threatening them with the destruction of Parliament. " In modern parlance this sounds a bit hysterical. I suggest quoting from some contemporary description, if you have one.</li>
<li>"eventually affirmed". As the timespan referred to is between April and 17 May, suggest "eventually" can be dispensed with. I would give the year, it's a significant date.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Retirement</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"effectively retired" Perhaps just "retired"?</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Personal life</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"through which" picky, but there's nothing that this refers to.</li>
<li>I gather Elizabeth predeceased Coke, but probably you should be clearer about this. (the infobox confirms this)</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Writings</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>I'm not thrilled about the firstly and secondly; it looks odd and I wonder why one firstly and the other secondly? Is there a ranking?</li>
<li>Should Institutes and also Reports be italicised in the Gest quote?</li>
<li>"His Law Reports, known as Coke's Reports, were an archive of law reports" perhaps one "reports" can be massaged out. This sentence can profitably be divided.</li>
<li>"four of which are still lost" strike "still", I would.</li>
<li>" by copying out and repeating cases found in earlier law reports, " This sounds like verbatim copying, how is it original work?</li>
<li>"Although lent to friends and family," slight disconnect in this sentence, the initial phrase should refer to the subject, which in this case is Coke, not his reports.</li>
<li>"While the Reports were intended " this sentence could also advantageously be split.</li>
<li>"There are also factual inaccuracies;" I suggest you buy a Coke for this sentence and place it somewhere therein.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Jurisprudence</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>" Alan Cromartie referred to as "an infinity of wisdom"" I would think something from Coke would be better suited here, since it is an important point we should hear from him.</li>
<li>"John Selden" I would either remind the reader of who he is or else link again. It's been a while.</li>
<li>Bacon has played a major part in this article and need not be linked again.</li>
<li>"play with it". I do not find this a pleasing phrase, as it implies arbitrariness (or perhaps capriciousness).</li>

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because I believe it meets the criteria, and covers a rather notable subject in detail.

<p><b>Oppose</b>, at least until the prose is cleaned up. Afew <i>examples</i> of what I'm talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li>"The students of Georgia Tech affectionately dubbed him "Funk Masta G. Wayne" during his presidency in accordance with the expansion and growth he encouraged in urban Atlanta ...". Accordance is clearly not the right word there.
<ul>

</li>
<li>"... Clough believed it detracted from the entirety of the exhibition, in which he believed 'to be a powerful exhibit about the contributions of gay and lesbian artists<span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>".

</ul>
</li>
<li>"Clough has earned numerous awards and honors during his career ... Dr. Clough has also earned a George Westinghouse Award from the American Society for Engineering Education". Why do we suddenly start calling him Dr. Clough?
<ul>
<li>That appears to have been fixed. <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>" Clough's decision was widely criticized, but Clough responded that he was protecting the Smithsonian's larger educational mission." Rather awkward and unnecessary repetition of "Clough".

</ul>
</li>
<li>" In 2011, Georgia Tech opened the G. Wayne Clough Undergraduate Learning Commons building to honor his commitment to undergraduate students". I'm quite certain that's not at all the reason they opened it, but it may be the reason they named it as they did.
<ul>
<li>Changed from "opened the ... building to honor his commitment" to "opened the ... building named in honor of his commitment" <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>"There Clough met his wife, Anne Olivia Robinson, while he was in middle school." No, he didn't meet his wife, he met his <i>future</i> wife.

<li>This has been fixed. <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Early life section recounts events up until 1994, when Clough was almost 53. Can't really consider that to be "early life". Also, much of the section isn't about either Clough's early life <i>or</i> education, it's about his academic career before becoming President of Georgia Tech. Overall, I think that there's undue emphasis on Clough's time at Georgia Tech compared to his time at Virginia Tech, for instance.
<ul>
<li>The article has been resectioned a bit, and his research at Virginia Tech has been beefed up a bit. <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"Clough's tenure was especially focused on a dramatic expansion of the Institute; over $1 billion was spent on expanding or improving the campus. These projects included the completion of several west campus dorms ...". What projects? The previous sentence was talking about tenure, not projects. Where did the money come from anyway?
<ul>
<li>Projects as in specific buildings, or collections thereof. A great deal of campus construction happened while he was president, and one of the largest responsibilities of the president is fundraising for whatever they want to build next. And it would be more accurate to ask where the money <i>didn't</i> come from - many of the buildings were funded by alumni donations along with funds specially procured from the state. I don't know how to encapsulate those facts into the article, though. <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

</li>
<li>"Clough's father died in February 1988, and his mother died in August 1994." Is that really relevant? And again, what does it have to do with either Clough's early life or his education?
<ul>
<li>They're biographical facts. The sentence has been somewhat adjusted, I believe, and the section has been renamed to "research". <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 17:53, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Which makes it doubly incomprehensible why the deaths of Clough's parents should be tagged on to the end of that section. Let's remind ourselves that this a biography of Clough, not his parents. Did their deaths affect him in any significant way for instance? <a href="User_George_Ponderevo" title="User:George Ponderevo">George Ponderevo</a> (<a href="User_talk_George_Ponderevo" title="User talk:George Ponderevo">talk</a>) 01:47, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>The timing of the deaths of his parents is significant since they both died shortly before Clough became President of Georgia Tech, which provides relevant biographical information. In other words, Clough was not able to share his increasing success and greater accomplishments with his parents due to the timing of their deaths. I recommend moving the information regarding his parents' deaths to another section of the article to resolve the concerns described above. <a href="User_Mistercontributer" title="User:Mistercontributer">Mistercontributer</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mistercontributer" title="User talk:Mistercontributer">talk</a>) 03:52, 6 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<li>What makes FindAGrave a high-quality reliable source?
<ul>
<li>I typically avoid FindAGrave as well, but used it to cite his parents' death dates as 1) that information is not contained in any other source I could find 2) it is noncontroversial information 3) a picture of the grave is included. So yes, I would prefer another source, but that seems like reasonably important uncontroversial information to me. Definitely a grey area as far as RS goes, though. I wouldn't be opposed to commenting out that sentence, but I wouldn't be happy about it. <a href="User_Disavian" title="User:Disavian">Disavian</a> (<a href="User_talk_Disavian" title="User talk:Disavian">talk</a>) 18:44, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>I think we can compromise here; I agree that it has a bit more detail than it needs, and I'll trim a bit. See what you think. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 22:37, 19 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I certainly don't have any problem with a trimming, but cutting out the info about the chocolate company is a big mistake. It can hardly be understated how strongly Canadians associated her name with chocolates, even amongst those familiar with the historical Secord. The <i>first</i> thing most Canadians think of when you mention her name is chocolates. In fact, I first visited the article myself to find out when she founded "her" chocolate company. I think it's important to emphasize they she is both unrelated to the chocolate company, and that her name is strongly associated with the chocolate company amongst Canadians. Otherwise, Canadians (who will almost certainly be the vast majority of readers) will be confused as to her relation with the company (as I was).
<ul>
<li>I didn't cut the information out of the article, I just reduced the bit in the lead to "<a href="Laura_Secord_Chocolates" title="Laura Secord Chocolates">Laura Secord Chocolates</a> are named for her." Change it however you want ... but if it feels too much like "product placement", then I'll stop here. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 00:45, 20 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I do undertand the "product placement" concerns, but please keep in mind that a quite significant number (quite likely a majority) of Canadian readers who come to this article will be curious about her realtion to the chocolate company. "Laura Secord Chocolates are named after her" only raises more questions than it answers. The fact that the fame of the chocolate company far overshadows Secord's own has more than one reference in the article, and I'm sure I could come up with more with little effort.</li>
<li>How about something like this? —
<dl>
<dd>Before: "On the centennial of her walk, businessman <a href="Frank_Patrick_O'Connor" title="Frank Patrick O'Connor">Frank Patrick O'Connor</a> named <a href="Laura_Secord_Chocolates" title="Laura Secord Chocolates">Laura Secord Chocolates</a> in her honour; it became the most successful candy retailer in Canada, and though the historical Secord and her family had no relation to it, amongst Canadians her name is most often associated with the candy company."</dd>
<dd>After: "Though the historical Secord and her family had no relation to it, most Canadians associate her name with the <a href="Laura_Secord_Chocolates" title="Laura Secord Chocolates">Laura Secord Chocolates</a> company, which was named in her honour on the centennial of her walk."</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li>I'm not really sure it's a good idea to leave out the "Canada's most successful candy retailer"; while I sympathise with the "product placement" concern, it <i>does</i> give context for non-Canadian readers—as in: why would Canadians associate her name with a candy company, and even if they do, why does it have to be in the lead?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If you're going to do more more trimming to the lead, there's one more detail I think is important not to lose: that her father fought on the American side in the Revolutionary war. Before I atrarted editing it, the article claimed Thomas Ingersoll was a <a href="United_Empire_Loyalist" title="United Empire Loyalist">United Empire Loyalist</a> (uncited, of course). It's a belief held by (or assumed) a certain number of Canadians, and I think it's important to disabuse readers of that notion. <span class="vcard"><span class="fn nickname"><a href="User_Curly_Turkey" title="User:Curly Turkey">Curly Turkey</a></span> (<a href="User_talk_Curly_Turkey" title="User talk:Curly Turkey">gobble</a>)</span> 23:10, 19 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Comments</b> Hi there. This is looking pretty good so far. Prose is largely up to snuff and I've started going through some of the references. There are some issues that need to be addressed (though nothing fatal to the article's FAC, at least upon my first read-through). There are the occasional jargon/unfamiliar reader concerns (ex. in the lead Gateshead F.C. is mentioned without cluing people to what sport they play; same deal with the 3,000m), colloquialisms ("slated"), and redundancies ("The report also noted concerns that the original <i>centrepiece</i> of the proposed village, the <i>ice rink</i>, may have been deterring investors and that a proposal to redevelop land at the Stadium of Light in Sunderland, which also proposed an <i>ice rink as a centrepiece</i>, was detracting from what councillors had hoped to be a unique feature of the proposed village."). The article should try to refrain from citing primary sources as much as possible--this mainly means the sports team websites. Also, much of the Transport section strikes me as problematic, as you are pretty much repeating map directions and primary source info from the Metro website.</p>

<li><b>Support</b> – As stated in the nomination, I contributed suggestions for the article at peer review; in addition, I did some copy-editing back then, and tweaked a few things before coming here. My impression back then was that the article would have a strong chance at passing FAC with additional copy-editing, which has been done by Sarastro. My only additional comment is that the note in the bibliography on abbreviations has no purpose now, since the abbreviations were removed after Wesley's review. Otherwise, I think that the article meets the FA criteria, and see no reason to withhold support as I have faith that the note will be fixed prompted. <a href="User_Giants2008" title="User:Giants2008"><font color="blue">Giants2008</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Giants2008" title="User talk:Giants2008"><font color="darkblue">Talk</font></a>) 01:27, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Oppose</b> <s>Initial comments</s>&#160;– the content seems satisfactory and the major information is there. But with regard to prose, it needs work. Choice of words appears problematic in some instances ("crush" is informal writing, and any reason "utilises" is used instead of "uses"?), and why link "teasing", the article for which does not disambiguate the meaning of the word in that context. Do you mean "seducing" (I haven't seen the video)? —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 00:19, 17 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>When I rewrote the section for a second time, I used 'crush' instead of limerence. Should I add that back instead? Also, I changed 'utilise'. As for teasing, I don't feel comfortable in writing 'seducing' instead because that is more persuading somebody to engage in sexual acts.

<dd>I'm thinking "was infatuated with", but that may give the wrong meaning and sounds, shall I say, fancy.

<p>In good conscience, I do not think the article is ready as a potential featured article yet. Work needs to be done throughout. The prose seems a little rushed and reads awkward in places. It needs to be tightened and be more cohesive.</p>
<ul>
<li>"It was composed by Dallas Austin in collaboration with the Sugababes, after group member Keisha Buchanan developed a crush on another artist who collaborated with Austin." – why not just "...Dallas Austin and the Sugababes..."? There is no need for the added words in this context.</li>
<li>"...compositionally, it makes use of various computer and electronic effects." – what is the difference between the two?</li>
<li>This is something I see pop up in a lot of pop music articles and I don't see it as necessary: you have "music critics" written. Why should the type of critic be noted in a <i>music</i> article? Would a film or video game critic review a pop song?</li>
<li>"also" is a needless word in these instances: "Some critics also named it one of best pop singles of the 2000s. The song attained worldwide success and became one of the Sugababes' most successful singles"; "It was also parodied by firefighers in Staffordshire, England."</li>
<li>I don't mind this one too much, but a better grammatical construction would be appreciated here: "It features <u>the Sugababes flirting</u> with three men in an elevator."</li>
<li>"numerous" – " The Sugababes have performed the song at numerous festivals and events such as Oxegen 2008 and the V Festival 2008." – that's a bit of a hyperbole.</li>
<li>There is more redundancy here: "They subsequently composed five tracks for the album, one of which was 'Push the Button'." – why "subsequently"? It's obvious. Likewise, "for the album".</li>
<li>The sentence immediately after begins with "Push the Button"... Not pleasant to read.</li>
<li>{{<a href="Template_Cquote" title="Template:Cquote" class="mw-redirect">cquote</a>}} is not used in lieu of block quotations. It is used for pull quotes that are already given in the article. Stick to {{<a href="Template_Quote" title="Template:Quote">quote</a>}} or the &lt;blockquote&gt; tags.</li>
<li>"Austin produced the song, while Rick Shepphard completed the engineering process." – just "...engineered it".</li>
<li>That last paragraph in the development and concept section needs reordering. Typically, recording is done before mixing and engineering.</li>
<li>"...the tempo of the song moves at a fast-paced 126 beats per minute" – subjective "fast-paced".</li>
<li>A few redundancies here: "while Joe Muggs of The Daily Telegraph noted that Austin's production of the song combines &lt;both electropop and American R&amp;B together." – first "both" is needless here and never say "combine ... together".</li>
<li>Content-wise, the composition section feels weak. We are given info about the genre, and musical technicalities, but there isn't enough on things like song structure and lyrical analysis, which I'd expect on an article about a major hit. The song was released over seven years ago; have you considered print sources?</li>
<li>Again, why "first" and "for release as" in, <span style="padding-right:.2em;">"</span>'Push the Button' was first announced for release as the lead single from Taller in More Ways in August 2005."</li>
<li>Still there are reundancies: "According to group member Heidi Range, the song was not intended to be the lead single, and <s>it</s> was the last track <s>to be</s> completed for the album."</li>
<li>Overlinking: why link "music critics"?</li>
<li>First paragraph in Release and reception does not have a smooth flow to it. For example, this is very repetitive: <span style="padding-right:.2em;">"</span>'Push the Button' was released as a CD single and digital download on 26 September 2005.[14][15] The tracks on the CD single and digital download include the single release of 'Push the Button'..."</li>
</ul>
<p>That's where I stopped. Till, it would be of your best interest to find a good uninvolved writer to give this article a thorough independent copy edit from top to bottom. And have a look at print sources that can strengthen the article's content and comprehensiveness. With a good amount of collaborative effort, this article can succeed. But right now, it is unfortunately not there yet. —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 15:09, 20 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Google Books usually doesn't have everything. There are bookstores, e-books and libraries too. But you're more likely to find good information from the 90s, which is unfortunate because the composition section is a little underwhelming.

<dd>For guitar-based songs, I typically check print magazines like <i>Guitar World</i>,<i>Musician</i>, and the like, who tend to delve into the musical/compositional side of things a lot. For a "non-rockist" pop song, it can be trickier; at most a web publication like Sound On Sound might talk about the production and how elements of the song are arranged. It's very possible you might end up with little information about the song's composition (I doubt you'll end up with a Composition section that looks like the one in <a href="Paranoid_Android#Composition_and_lyrics" title="Paranoid Android">"Paranoid Android"</a>), but make all efforts to find any relevant information that might exist--as WikiPenguin said, that involves scouring print resources. Also, I'd recommend refraining from citing the sheet music, which is akin to citing the screenplay of a film; commentary on what's notable in a song should be drawn from independent, secondary sources.

<dd>That's unfortunate. I think we have a case similar to that of <a href="Rehab_(Rihanna_song)" title="Rehab (Rihanna song)">Rehab (Rihanna song)</a>: they have the major information, but they don't go into enough detail. "Rehab" is an FA, and one I supported because it is as comprehensive as can be, and it is well presented. So since we've as much information as we can have, the presentation is the one chance we have to make this article shine as "one of Wikipedia's best". That comes with good organization, flow and language. That is to say we should work towards a thorough copy edit. Also, the sound sample in this article does not seem very useful. What value does it have for enhancing the reader's understanding of the article? —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 13:27, 2 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>You're welcome. I hope you find something. You'll need a better rationale to keep the sample than just the use of computer effects.

<ul>
<li>Lead sentence says just "Sugababes", while following instances use "<i>the</i> Sugababes". I'd probably tweak this sentence to clarify.</li>
<li>"It was composed by Dallas Austin and the Sugababes, and was inspired by a crush that group member Keisha Buchanan developed on another artist."—probably "...was inspired by an infatuation that group member Keisha Buchanan developed with another artist."</li>
<li><span style="padding-right:.2em;">"</span>'Push the Button' is a pop and electropop song with elements of electronic and R&amp;B."—some redundancy here. Electropop is just a subgenre of pop and electronic. Essentially, it's an electropop song with elements of R&amp;B.</li>
<li>Likewise, there is redundancy in the infobox too.</li>
<li>"It makes use of various computer effects, and is lyrically about a woman's sexual frustration of being unnoticed by a man."—just "uses". In most circumstances, avoid expressions such as "make use of", "make plans to", etcetera, when these can be expressed with one verb.</li>
<li>Reword so that we don't have two consecutive paragraphs beginning with the title of the song.</li>
<li>"...who praised the conception as clever, as well its production and sound."—clunky.</li>
<li>"The song attained worldwide success and became one of the Sugababes' most successful singles."—does not read nicely owing to the repetition.</li>
<li>"It features the Sugababes flirting with three men in an elevator. The Sugababes have performed the song at festivals and events such as Oxegen 2008 and the V Festival 2008."—also repetitive. Why not "the group", instead, in the second sentence?</li>

<ul>
<li>"It was released as a CD single and digital download on 26 September 2005.

<li>"An extended play of 'Push the Button' was also released, which includes..."&amp;mdahs;erroneous grammar and redundancy. You have the title of the song twice in that sentence, so "of 'Push the Button<span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" can be removed. "Also" can be removed as well. And when you have "which", the noun that it refers to should directly precede it. Otherwise, write "including".</li>
<li>"... composed by the Sugababes, Cathy Dennis, and Guy Sigsworth."—use "written" here to avoid repetition.</li>
<li>I think the prose in the first paragraph should be varied more. Repetitive prose seems to be an issue in the article and needs to be dealt with. Sentence structures are far too similar. Be a little more creative with the wording (e.g. "Island Records released an extended play", or something like that).</li>
<li>"Linda McGee from RTÉ.ie applauded the song's beat and melody, and suggested that it was the best track on the album."—"suggested" doesn't seem like the best word to use. Maybe "wrote" or something similarly simple.</li>
<li>There's more repetitive prose here. Every sentence begins in the second paragraph begins with "[Reporter] of [magazine]". It's almost as proseliny in the third paragraph.</li>
<li>"Alexis Petridis of The Guardian described the melody of 'Push the Button' as 'sweet and addictive as Smarties'."—well of course it's the melody of "PTB"; what other song would it be? There're many times you write "of 'Push the Button<span style="padding-right:.2em;">'</span>" when all the words are doing is just fluffing up the prose.</li>

<li>"Several models and dancers auditioned to appear in the video, and were selected based on their dancing talent."—even models were chosen based on dancing talent?</li>
<li>"Buena described it as a 'really cheeky video', while Buchanan expressed her desire for it to be more suggestive."—this lacks logical flow and has poor connection. Also, it's wordy. Surely by "expressed her desire for", you mean "wanted".</li>
<li>"Some clips were removed from the final product due to their sexual content."—"due to" is adjectival. The <i>removal</i> of the clips was "due to" the sexual content, but they <i>were removed</i> "owing to" or "because of" it.</li>
<li>"The video features Range, Buchanan and Buena on separate floors of an elevator."—you might not even need this sentence since it's explained in the following sentences.</li>
<li>I may be wrong, but do they use "elevator" in the UK?</li>

<p><b>Brianboulton comments</b>: I did a partial prose review at the August 2012 FAC. I think the prose is now considerably improved; I have made a couple of minor edits, and suggest you consider a few more:</p>
<ul>
<li>At present, too many sentences begin with "'Push the Button'...", sometimes successively. You should try to vary this more.</li>
<li>Some whole sentences are rather repetitiously worded. For example, " 'Push the Button' debuted at number two on the Irish Singles Chart and peaked at number one the following week, becoming the group's first single to top the chart in Ireland" is followed soon after by "'Push the Button' debuted at number one on the Austrian Singles Chart and held the position for five consecutive weeks, becoming the Sugababes' best-performing single in Austria" and then "'Push the Button' debuted at number five on the German Singles Chart and peaked at number two three weeks later". Again, more variation in the prose would improve readability.</li>
<li>Delete the word "Synoptically". It's usually a bad idea to begin sentences with adverbs, and this is no exception. The section makes perfect sense without it.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other than these suggestions, I can't see a great deal wrong with the prose. Editors with better knowledge of popular music than mine will have to decide whether the content is adequate and comprehensive, and I'll keep an eye on the review to see how things develop in that direction. Maybe the other reviewers could summarise, bearing in mind your responses so far, what they think is still lacking in the article? <a href="User_Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a> (<a href="User_talk_Brianboulton" title="User talk:Brianboulton">talk</a>) 00:20, 7 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> Good luck with your first FAC. I hope it's successful and the first of many. On the substance, I was very surprised that I couldn't find any mention in the article of why it's called "Sacred". This seems to be a major oversight (unless it's just my error!) and needs to be addressed, even if it's just a sourced comment that says we don't know why it's called that. --<a href="User_Dweller" title="User:Dweller">Dweller</a> (<a href="User_talk_Dweller" title="User talk:Dweller">talk</a>) 16:40, 16 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<ul>
<li>I think it is in italics because of the infobox. I used infobox:artwork ans i think it does that to article titles. I do not believe that is should be in italics as no source italicizes the name and it is more of a ceremonial name than an official one (see the section about the etymology i recently added). I do not know how to fix the italicization of the title.--<a href="User_Found5dollar" title="User:Found5dollar">Found5dollar</a> (<a href="User_talk_Found5dollar" title="User talk:Found5dollar">talk</a>) 13:26, 21 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
<li>As a piece of sculpture, yes, the title should be in italics. See <a href="Wikipedia_ITALICTITLE" title="Wikipedia:ITALICTITLE" class="mw-redirect">WP:ITALICTITLE</a> which says, "Use italics when italics would be used in running text; for example, taxonomic names, the names of ships, the titles of books, films, and other <i>creative works</i>, and foreign phrases are italicized both in ordinary text and in article titles."

<li>good point. I have removed the info box but left the image.--<a href="User_Found5dollar" title="User:Found5dollar">Found5dollar</a> (<a href="User_talk_Found5dollar" title="User talk:Found5dollar">talk</a>) 04:40, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>{{<a href="Template_Infobox_artifact" title="Template:Infobox artifact">Infobox artifact</a>}} could have been used to avoid the italics, but Tomcat's point about "serv[ing] no real purpose as we can find that information aleady in the lead" is not a valid reason to remove the infobox. Infoboxes are designed to be a quick summary of key points, even more so than the lead. Have only 30 seconds to scan the article for the gist of the subject? Read the infobox. Have a bit more than 30 seconds, read the lead. Have enough time to read the whole article, then... well, you get the point. See the talk page of this FAC for a sample infobox that would have retained all of the information and avoided the italics, however, as a sculpture, the article should be italicizing the name throughout. <span style="background:#006B54; padding:2px;"><b><a href="User_Imzadi1979" title="User:Imzadi1979"><font color="white">Imzadi&#160;1979</font></a>&#160;<a href="User_talk_Imzadi1979" title="User talk:Imzadi1979"><font color="white"><big>→</big></font></a></b></span> 07:26, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>So your suggestion is to re-add the infobox and italicize <b>Sacred Cod</b> throughout the article? I am just a little hesitant because the term "Sacred Cod of Massachusetts" is not it's official title, as it has none, and is almost more of a description people use to identify what is being talked about, than an artistic work's title.--<a href="User_Found5dollar" title="User:Found5dollar">Found5dollar</a> (<a href="User_talk_Found5dollar" title="User talk:Found5dollar">talk</a>) 15:59, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>This article falls well short of being Wikipedia's "very best work".</p>
<ul>
<li>The writing is far from being "engaging, even brilliant, and of a professional standard" e.g.
<ul>
<li><i>fisherman devised a story that cod was the fish multiplied by Jesus during the miracle of the loaves and fishes. This false claim helped distinguish the two fishes' markings</i></li>
<li><i>Wood was incredibly scarce during the occupation</i></li>
<li><i>the theft plan continued without a hitch</i></li>
<li><i>While the Sacred Cod was dusted for fingerprints, and threats of the responsible parties being charged with "criminal trespass" and "attempted larceny", no one was ever charged for the actions of that weekend.</i></li>
<li><i>The Massachusetts State Police were called in to assist with the search for the cod. They went so far as to dredge the Charles River, in hopes of recovering the Sacred Cod. The authorities also found out that a member of the Lampoon staff was on board a plane heading to Newark, New Jersey. They searched Boston Airport and wired the authorities in Newark to search the plane the student was on when it arrived, but the cod was still not recovered</i> (How about <i>The State Police even dredged the Charles River and, learning that a Lampoon editor had flown to New Jersey, had the plane searched on landing.</i>)</li>
<li><i>On April 27, the Crimson gave the staff of the Lampoon an ultimatum; if they would not give the Sacred Cod, by midnight, to them so the Crimson could take credit for its return, the Crimson would go public with its findings. After not receiving a reply from the Lampoon, the details of theft were printed in the next morning's edition of the Crimson.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Irrelevant material is included for no apparent purpose e.g.
<ul>
<li><i>A fire in 1747 destroyed the Sacred Cod as well as state owned records, books and paintings, and large amounts of wines and other liquors belonging to private business who used the cellars of the building as storage. The entire interior of the building was destroyed, but the brick walls were left intact and used when the building was rebuilt.</i> (Told the entire interior of the State House was destroyed, most readers' native shrewdness will tell them that records, books and paintings would have been lost. And what do the liquor and reuse of the walls have to do with anything?)</li>
<li><i>the Atlantic cod's conservation status was changed to Vulnerable species in 1996 and it is in danger of becoming commercially extinct.</i></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Inapproriate use of sources:
<ul>
<li>Stating flatly that, "To help determine the difference between cod and haddock, fisherman devised a story..." simply because a popular magazine recited this folkway is not appropriate. Anyway, the source doesn't even say that fishermen devised the story; it says the story about the origin of the markings is "part of New England mystique" and, separately, that fishermen distinguish cod from haddock via the markings.</li>
<li>The Museum of Hoaxes website, which is cited extensively, cannot (I believe) be considered a reliable source -- it appears to be just someone's fun website. Note that it asserts something ("Traditionally, the head of the cod points at whichever party is currently in power") which the article explicitly denies.</li>
<li>Celebrate Boston also appears to be simply a commercial website without obvious editorial oversight</li>
<li>Since the Crimson itself participated in the incident, its own report is essentially a primary (not secondary) source and can be used as a fact source only with great caution, especially since it clearly speaks with tongue partially in cheek.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There's far too much "Background". All that's needed is one or two reliable sources establishing that the reason the cod hangs in the State House is its traditional importance in the area, or whatever, plus a few examples of the cod's use as a symbol in seals etc., and maybe something like the Morison quote. This isn't an article about the fishing industry -- all this detail about the number of boats and so on is irrelevant.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The photos of the Crimson building and UMass are deadweight far disconnected from the article subject. "This is the building that housed the newspaper that had an editor who was kidnapped by the jokesters that stole the cod that hung in the chambers that were in the House the Bulfinch built." Exterior photos of the Old and modern State Houses would be more appropriate.</li>
<li>Useful and enlivening sources are not incorporated e.g. (some of these might be in the article already, and probably most are not fruitful -- but some absolutely belong):

<li>There is far too much detail about the thefts -- exact time of recovery; order in which various parts of the State House were searched; what was worn by men jumping out of the car; that a chair, then a ladder, then wire cutters, were used; etc. -- about 1/3 of the article.

<dd><i>Three days after the theft, a search of the State House began when another phone call was received, this time by a man described as "the father of one of the students reported to have taken the cod." He explained that the students never removed the carving from the State House and they had stashed it somewhere in the cellar of the building. Capitol police searched the cellar, found nothing, then continued their search on the upper levels of the building. At 5:30 p.m. on November 17, 1968, the Sacred Cod was found standing on its tail just outside the House Chamber behind a door in a hallway used only while the House is in session. Apparently after the thieves had taken the 80 pounds (36 kg) fish down from its hanging place, they had brought it down a private staircase and left it in this hallway undamaged.</i></dd>

<li>As it says on my user page, time on the internet is currently at a premium for me, as I do not have it at my house right now. I will begin working on these notes as soon as possible, but I have also noticed you are extensively editing the article as well. When looking at a few of your suggestions here, it seems you have already fixed them yourself. Could you please note when you do that? Also much of the "detail about the thefts" and the information in the background section you do not agree with was requested to be included in previous peer reviews. The same goes for the section about the theft you moved to notes. It was explicitly requested to be in the article in a peer review. Later today or tomorrow, when I have time to edit, and have internet available, I will begin working on your notes. <a href="User_Found5dollar" title="User:Found5dollar">Found5dollar</a> (<a href="User_talk_Found5dollar" title="User talk:Found5dollar">talk</a>) 16:40, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating this for featured article because... I believe it meets the criteria. Andrew Johnson is today not considered anywhere near the top of the list for American presidents. Yet he had a public career of over forty years, and became the only former president to serve in the Senate, so I hope you'll agree that there's more to the man than met the eye when they impeached him. Enjoy.

<li>"As a consequence, Johnson assumed an attitude of white supremacy, which he kept throughout his life.": I removed "As a consequence" and otherwise left this alone. I guess this is mainly a personal preference based on what seems to me to be a firm trend in expository prose, but IMO there's a broader point; feel free to disagree. Sociologists and historians can make scientific statements about attitudes associated with certain economic conditions. They're on slightly looser ground when they assert which way the causation goes ... but the case can be made. They're on quicksand when they attempt to assert that a <i>particular</i> 19th-century figure's attitudes were a direct result of such-and-such; for all we know, he had unfortunate experiences in his formative years, or he got his attitudes from his mother. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 21:15, 16 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li><s>Oppose.</s> Sorry, but we're not off to a good start ... I picked just one issue, misuse of "which", and pointed out all the problems, and it's still wrong: "t Buchanan", "which had been in revolt", "engaging in arguments with hecklers which were seen as undignified for a president" (among other problems, referent and verb don't agree: it wasn't the (plural) arguments that were undignified, or the hecklers, it was that he was engaging in them, so "were" is wrong), "days which followed", "deep flaws which sabotaged his presidency". Disclaimers on "which": I've noticed that people who write about earlier times use the word more liberally, because that's how it was used back then. It continues to be used in the sense you're using it informally (I use that way all the time), and it is also used in the best prose occasionally to signal emphasis. Having said all that: this oppose is not a "thumbs down" of any kind, simply an admission that there's more to do here than I have time to do, particularly if I have to go back and check to see if you've really made the fixes you said you did. If you can find another copyeditor who does have time, and I get the sense that they're doing a thorough job, I'll be more than happy to strike my oppose and turn the job over to them. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 19:44, 18 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p><b>Support</b> . I carried out a detailed informal peer review, details on the article's talkpage. I am happy with the responses, and have just a few points outstanding:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the "Congressman" section: "general-election" is not a hyphenated term</li>
<li>In the same part of that section (and continuing a point I raised in the review): "Rival for a fifth term" implies that both Haynes and Johnson were seeking fifth terms. Was this the case? Otherwise, they were merely rival candidates for election.</li>
<li>In the "Impeachment" section there are two separate mentions of Stanbery giving up his office to act as Johnson's counsel.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have also done some general copyediting. The nom may have been a mite premature, but I believe that the prose is now of the required standard, the narrative is compelling and the research looks terrific. I have not done an image review but I can't see any likely problems here. This looks a fine addition to the "American presidents" series (only about 30 to go and they'll all be FAs) <a href="User_Brianboulton" title="User:Brianboulton">Brianboulton</a> (<a href="User_talk_Brianboulton" title="User talk:Brianboulton">talk</a>) 20:43, 23 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<p><b>Comments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In November 1867, "the Democrats took control of the Ohio General Assembly, allowing them to defeat for re-election [...] Senator Benjamin Wade". According to his <a href="Benjamin_Wade" title="Benjamin Wade">article</a>, he was elected senator in 1863 and did not faced election this year.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>
<dl>
<dd>Before 1866, states were rather random with how they elected senators; Johnson wasn't even elected until after his term began in 1857 (there was probably some shenanigans with split control of legislative houses to avoid a Senate election, too, that happened a lot in Tennessee). In 1866, Congress passed legislation that standardized when the election of senators took place. Congress decreed that the election take place shortly after the legislature which would be in office when the Senate term expired first convened. So Wade's term expired March 3, 1869, and the Ohio legislature which would be in session when his term expired was elected in November 1867 and would convene in January 1868, and the law forced them to begin the balloting for senator the second week of the legislative session, and to keep voting if they couldn't decide. So basically, Wade became a lame duck a little under 14 months before the end of his term. Ohio changed this, to even-year elections, in 1905.--<a href="User_Wehwalt" title="User:Wehwalt">Wehwalt</a> (<a href="User_talk_Wehwalt" title="User talk:Wehwalt">talk</a>) 22:31, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Learn about Rakoto Frah, possibly the greatest cultural hero of Madagascar in the 20th century - all because of his incredible skills and creativity as a performer of the <i>sodina</i>, a traditional flute brought over with the island's original Indonesian settlers more than two millennia ago. Although Rakoto Frah isn't well known in the US, Ian Anderson, flutist of Jethro Tull, cited him as an influence.

How about tacking this onto the next sentence that details the performances, for example:
<dl>
<dd>Among the 80 competitors, hailing from a variety of countries, Rakoto Frah's troupe won the gold medal. This success was followed by performances in Japan, England, the United States, India, Germany, China, Norway, Finland, Australia and France, making Frah one of the first musicians to perform traditional Malagasy music at music festivals and concerts outside of Madagascar. At these performances, he was often accompanied by supporting musicians under the group name Orchestre Nationale.</dd>

<ul>
<li>This is a typical problem for musicians in developing countries, and this question also came up in the Jaojoby FAC. The sources don't explain it, but I know from discussing the issue with the musicians themselves that musicians really don't get that much money from each album sold overseas, and world music is never enough of a hot seller internationally to earn the musicians loads of money. Tours overseas often barely break even, again because of the expense of touring coupled with relatively limited returns to the artists, whether because of small shows or being one small part of a larger festival where the profits are split among many. Local sales don't wind up being a source of income either because of bootlegging, so artists make most of their money from local gigs, and wind up having to domestically tour and perform pretty much constantly as a result. <a href="User_Lemurbaby" title="User:Lemurbaby">Lemurbaby</a> (<a href="User_talk_Lemurbaby" title="User talk:Lemurbaby">talk</a>) 18:43, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

Please trim the lead down to three paragraphs, weeding out excessive detail and instead giving a more concise overview of what's to be expected further down. For example, there's quite a bit of unnecessary discussion of the song's chart performance and sales. That needs to be tightened.</s> Overall, this seems to be an engaging article. —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 00:51, 17 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The source citing the material being summarized here (in the "Legacy" section) refers to it as R&amp;B's "golden age" during "the summer of 2001". I removed "summer" in the lead and replaced "period of peak activity" with "golden age", but could there be something synonymous with "summer" in the "Legacy" section? The timing seems pertinent to the period discussed, not simply 2001.
<dl>
<dd>To be honest, "golden age" is even more unclear. Maybe, "Released in mid-2001, a period when contemporary R&amp;B was popular, <i>Aaliyah</i> has been cited by critics as one of the best R&amp;B albums of its time." I hope that does not modify the meaning of what you're trying to say. —<a href="User_Wikipedian_Penguin" title="User:Wikipedian Penguin"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" color="black"><big><b>WP:</b></big><font color="#0075FF"><b>PENGUIN</b></font></font></a> <b>·</b> <sup>[ <a href="User_talk_Wikipedian_Penguin#top" title="User talk:Wikipedian Penguin">TALK</a> ]</sup> 19:25, 4 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Considering the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/golden%20age">definition</a>, and the way it's used by the sources in the section this is summarizing, it's not referring to (only) popularity but artistic peak in the genre as well. "A period when..." gives off the impression that mid-2001 was the only such period. English-language readers should understand the phrase "golden age", as it's commonly used enough when discussing the arts &amp; entertainment, and doesnt seem colloquial or too informal. The best I could come up with to rephrase but preserve the same meaning is "period of peak activity", or perhaps "released during an artistic and commercial high point in contemporary R&amp;B"? "Mid-2001" is definitely better though. <a href="User_Dan56" title="User:Dan56">Dan56</a> (<a href="User_talk_Dan56" title="User talk:Dan56">talk</a>) 01:05, 5 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>The 3rd paragraph of his paragraph speaks of the album in this context: "Each structure invites you inside but won't resolve ...

<p>On March 19, 2011, I was present at the official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the completion of SR 52 from La Jolla (San Diego), where I got my undergraduate degree, to Santee. I have wanted to bring this to FA standard for personal reasons (after SR 78, my first edit and my first FA). However, SR 57 and 56 managed to get in line first...

<p><b>Comments by Cwmhiraeth</b> - It states in the WikiCup rules "You must declare your WikiCup participation if you review another WikiCup participant's FAC" so I hereby declare it!</p>
<dl>
<dd>My first impression was of a very well-written article and much of the prose flows easily along. A few minor comments:</dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>"Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing the troops, only to join in Okabe's defeat in the Battle of Wau." - To someone like me who knows little on this subject, this sentence is not self-explanatory.
<ul>
<li>Re-phrased to <i>Nonetheless, the convoy succeeded in reaching Lae on 7 January and landing its troops, but Okabe was defeated in the <a href="Battle_of_Wau" title="Battle of Wau">Battle of Wau</a>.</i> <a href="User_Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7">Hawkeye7</a> (<a href="User_talk_Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7">talk</a>) 21:10, 24 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"In the South West Pacific, the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was interdiction of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes" - "interdiction" seems a curious word to use here.
<ul>
<li>It's a highly technical term. Linked to the article. <a href="User_Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7">Hawkeye7</a> (<a href="User_talk_Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7">talk</a>) 21:10, 24 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>"But the results of the effort against the January convoy were very disappointing." - Maybe join this sentence with the previous one so that you don't have a sentence starting with "but".
<ul>
<li>Rephrased to <i>In the South West Pacific, a conventional strategic bombing campaign was out of the question because industrial targets in Japan were well beyond the range of even the largest strategic bombers operating from bases in Australia and New Guinea, so the primary mission of the Allied bomber force was <a href="Air_interdiction" title="Air interdiction">interdiction</a> of Japanese supply lines, especially the sea lanes. The results of the effort against the January convoy were therefore very disappointing.</i> <a href="User_Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7">Hawkeye7</a> (<a href="User_talk_Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7">talk</a>) 21:10, 24 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A number of places are mentioned in the article ( Rabaul, Lae, Finschhafen etc). It would be nice to have a map showing their locations as an aid to understanding the account. The present maps are low resolution, in Japanese and limited to Japanese vessel movements. Ideally the map would show where the American air bases were located, where the convoy was when attacked etc. <a href="User_Cwmhiraeth" title="User:Cwmhiraeth">Cwmhiraeth</a> (<a href="User_talk_Cwmhiraeth" title="User talk:Cwmhiraeth">talk</a>) 11:08, 24 January 2013 (UTC)

<li>What you say may be correct but the print is miniscule and the red lines difficult to distinguish. A better map would improve the article. <a href="User_Cwmhiraeth" title="User:Cwmhiraeth">Cwmhiraeth</a> (<a href="User_talk_Cwmhiraeth" title="User talk:Cwmhiraeth">talk</a>) 06:52, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>The chronology of the Allied tactics section doesn't flow well. We start with poor results from the January attack, review weaponry modifications and skip-bombing tactics, presumably both already in practice and then review the available Allied air units. I'd have to think more for a suggestion on how exactly to fix this, but it does need fixing.

<li>What kind of tonnage are you talking about for the Japanese transports? GRT, DWT? And what are the cubic meters for? I've never seen them used for any ship in all my readings.
<ul>
<li>Per the link, GRT. This is a unit of <i>volume</i>. For example, the <a href="Japanese_transport_Aiyo_Maru" title="Japanese transport Aiyo Maru">Japanese transport Aiyo Maru</a> was 2,746 tons (GRT) but 4,331 tons (DWT). The former is used, as it is what appears in all the sources. <a href="User_Hawkeye7" title="User:Hawkeye7">Hawkeye7</a> (<a href="User_talk_Hawkeye7" title="User talk:Hawkeye7">talk</a>) 07:33, 1 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Tell the reader up front that these are GRT. Just like you tell xe that a given ship is a destroyer or whatever; don't make xe work for it. I presume that you're converting from GRT to derive the cubic meters, but why? It seems pointless and I've never seen any source do it when dealing with wartime merchantmen or convoys. The GRT is normally all that's given.--<a href="User_Sturmvogel_66" title="User:Sturmvogel 66">Sturmvogel 66</a> (<a href="User_talk_Sturmvogel_66" title="User talk:Sturmvogel 66">talk</a>) 07:50, 10 February 2013 (UTC)

<li>Well, <i>you</i> didn't realise that they were gross register tons. Changed the first occurrence to write it out in long hand.

<ul>
<li>I suspect that you're overthinking here; readers may not understand confuse GRT and displacement, but they can easily understand the ratios between the tonnages to know relative sizes of the ships. Which is all that's really necessary unless they're the quartermaster in charge of loading those selfsame ships.

<dd>As I said in my good article review, I felt the article was pretty much ready for FA status then. I find that the best good article reviews point towards FAC, and I try to do that in many of my own reviews; in this case, there was nothing else I could say. I read through the article again, and was happy that it was ready. I was also declaring a possible conflict of interest so that delegates could take that into account, if they felt it important.

<dd>Perhaps you should also consider whether you yourself make FA reviews more nitpicky and tedious than necessary.

You also make blanket announcements of wanting "large changes", without actually specifying what it is you dislike. That is useless <a href="Handwaving" title="Handwaving">handwaving</a>. And even when one of your subjective, non-FAC criterion suggestions are rejected, you stubbornly refuse to let them go. Sometimes it appears like you haven't even read the articles to begin with, since what you ask for is often already present, or is a complete misinterpretation. I say this from experience.

<dd>I don't think that looks good, it creates clutter of images on the right side. Again, it is just a guideline for <i>faces</i>, not an FA criterion. Tons of other animal FAs have images that face away from the text. The problem would be the long synonym list, not the quotes. The guideline specifically says: "It is often preferable to place images of faces so that the face or eyes look toward the text. However, images of people need not be reversed simply to make the person's face point towards the text, and this should not be done if the reversal would materially mislead the viewer (e.g., by making the subject of the article or section appear to have a birthmark on the left side of his face, when the birthmark is actually on the right side)."<a class="external autonumber" href="Wikipedia_Manual_of_Style/Images#Location">[58]</a> <a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 20:42, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Move it back if you wish; I'm not going to tangle over one image.

<dd>I added the MOS guideline above. As for quote boxes, I don't see what they have to do with anything? An image can be right aligned even if there's a box. The problem is that the taxobox has a long list of synonyms, which makes it intrude far down. I've fixed it by making the list collabsible and then right aligned the image in question.<a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 20:49, 22 January 2013 (UTC)

<p>I agree with Snowmanradio that this article is hard to follow, and suggest clarity can be added right here in the lead:</p>
<ul>
<li>In the late 20th century, the discovery of a subfossil species of ibis led to the idea that the accounts actually referred to this bird.</li>
</ul>
<p>The accounts of the Reunion Solitaires? "This bird" equals the Reunion Ibis? Too much confusion about which bird is which, I think can be tightened in this one sentence in the lead. Clarify "the accounts" and clarify "this bird". "The accounts" refers apparently to the previous para. <a href="User_SandyGeorgia" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_SandyGeorgia" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 20:38, 22 January 2013 (UTC) <a href="User_SandyGeorgia" title="User:SandyGeorgia">Sandy<font color="green">Georgia</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_SandyGeorgia" title="User talk:SandyGeorgia">Talk</a>) 20:38, 22 January 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Check and Hume 2004 (one of the main sources) use "solitaire" 46 times in their article.

<dd>The Cheke and Hume paper says that the Reunion Ibis clearly has an African origin and is descended from Malagasy forms. Going on this, I think that the article might have the wrong emphasis in saying that its closest relatives are the African Ibis (from Africa) and the Straw-necked Ibis (from Australia). Some of the other Ibises of the same genus are also mainly black and white, so the article's emphasis of the black and white colour of those two ibises does not make sense to me. It is difficult to know what to do when different authorities have different opinions; however, there is no ambiguity in Cheke and Hume, who say "clearly has an African origin", so why ignore it. <a href="User_Snowmanradio" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> (<a href="User_talk_Snowmanradio" title="User talk:Snowmanradio">talk</a>) 21:48, 21 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>The thing is, the actual describers, Mourer-Chauviré and Moutou did a cladistic analysis, where those two species were found to be about equally close to the Réunion bird. Ther Australian one is even closer in one feature: "In T. solitarius the minor and major metacarpals are fused over a longer distance, at both proximal and distal extremities, than in T. aethiopicus, but the same is true in T. spinicollis".

<dd>Whereas Cheke and Hume proposed an Asian origin, only to be proven wrong a few years later. The Dodo and Rodrigues Solitaire, on the other hand, have been shown to be of Asian origin, through genetic analysis. The jury is still out on the Red Rail. In any case, the following should be enough: "The African Sacred Ibis also has similar coloured plumage to that described in the old descriptions of the Réunion Solitaire.

In a perfect world the two paragraphs which deal with taxonomy would be merged and slightly shortened while the end of the last paragraph would be split to a new, slightly extended one on ecology, habitat and extinction, but this is a matter of slight sentence-shuffling: FA-class is not reserved for perfect articles. <a href="User_Thumperward" title="User:Thumperward">Chris Cunningham (user:thumperward)</a> (<a href="User_talk_Thumperward" title="User talk:Thumperward">talk</a>) 14:47, 24 January 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have been thinking about the length of the introduction, which now consists of four paragraphs including a double-sized second paragraph. The suggested length is two or three paragraphs for an article the size of this one. I think that the introduction needs to be simplified and shortened. I am aware that my suggestion is does not offer any specific copy-editing suggestions and that Wiki guidelines on introduction length are not strict rules, so I would welcome opinions on the length and complexity of the introduction.

The article says "Mourer-Chauvire suggested that this was dependent on fat-cycles", which has turned into "seasonal fat-cycles" in the introduction.

As for Rothschild, he wasn't exactly known for being cautious with his interpretations of old sources. <a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 00:18, 29 January 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>...but "-chick" in English does imply a young bird or a very young bird. Saying that a bird has legs like a turkey chick is not very descriptive without specifying the age of the chick. I think that the Frenchman was using everyday animal comparisons in his account that people would easily understand. Similarly many anatomy descriptions are based on everyday items; for example a "<a href="Nutmeg_liver" title="Nutmeg liver" class="mw-redirect">nutmeg liver</a>". <a href="User_Snowmanradio" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> (<a href="User_talk_Snowmanradio" title="User talk:Snowmanradio">talk</a>) 12:42, 29 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>In any case, the 1848 translation by Strickland omits "chick", so we could perhaps use his instead. <a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 16:41, 29 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Another difference is that the 1897 translation says "It is one of the best Game on the Island" at the end (the same as Google translator). I think that translation is a art and subjective, so I suggest providing more than one in-line citation for the sourcing of a translation. <a href="User_Snowmanradio" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> (<a href="User_talk_Snowmanradio" title="User talk:Snowmanradio">talk</a>) 17:32, 29 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Hume and Cheke 2004 call it a turkey in their paper when they refer to Dubois' work. See also note 2 in that paper where they attribute Oliver as the translator and point out another error in Oliver's translation, which appears in the article, helping to prove that the quote is actually from Oliver's work. To me it seems that the translation peculiarities indicate that sections of Oliver's 1897 work appears in long quotes in the article and these are not properly attributed.

<dd>The original quotes and translations (where necessary) of the quotes may all be in PD by luck rather than judgement, but I think that you will need to make this obvious in the documentation by finding out about the date of the translation.

See <a href="Wikipedia_Plagiarism#Public-domain_sources" title="Wikipedia:Plagiarism">Wikipedia:Plagiarism#Public-domain_sources</a>, which says "Whether copyright-expired or in the public domain for other reasons, material from public-domain sources is welcome on Wikipedia, but such material must be properly attributed.".

<dd>I think that your comment could have been phrased differently. Anybody can see the long translated quotes in the article that are based on Dubois 1674 French book alongside Oliver's 1897 English translation and see similarities. I note that Rothchild's book was published in 1907.

<dd>Have you noticed that I generally implement the suggestions of other reviewers much faster than yours? That is for reasons I have already outlined. You make some good, relevant suggestions, but bury them in dozens of puzzling suggestions that are not based on FA criteria, you never give those up in spite of counter arguments, and this makes people frustrated and confused. I know it isn't just me, I've seen other reviews you've made that had the same problem, for example this<a class="external autonumber" href="Talk_Saint_Croix_Macaw/GA1">[67]</a> one, where you completely misinterpret the GA criteria (is <a href="Abuwtiyuw" title="Abuwtiyuw">Abuwtiyuw</a> comprehensive?), and basically mislead the reviewer into failing a GA, without allowing the nominator to address the issues raised prior to this. And it was subsequently listed<a class="external autonumber" href="Wikipedia_Good_article_reassessment/Saint_Croix_Macaw/1">[68]</a> in spite of your protests, because they were ill-founded.

<li>I can not translate Dubois's original books from French to English; however, Check &amp; Hume point out that there are errors in the translation of Dubois's book by Caption Oliver. I think that a more accurate translation of Dubois's quote is; "These birds are so-called solitaires because they are always found alone. They are as big as a goose and their plumage is white, with black tips to the wings and the tail. The tail has some feathers resembling an ostrich. They have a long neck and a beak shaped like the wood-cocks but larger. Their legs and feet are like those of the turkey. This bird is caught by running after it, as it flies very little. It is the best game of the island." See Check &amp; Hume and <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.messybeast.com/extinct/dodo-solitaire.htm">Dodo-solitaire</a>. I think that the errors in Oliver's translation should not be transcribed into the quotes in the Wiki article. The changes would relate to its flight and the description of its legs with a likeness to a Turkey or Turkey-chick so I think that these are rather important. <a href="User_Snowmanradio" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> (<a href="User_talk_Snowmanradio" title="User talk:Snowmanradio">talk</a>) 15:55, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>It is explained on page 71 of Cheke and Hume 2004. It is very easy to find by searching for Turkey.

<dd>Please cut out the "spoonfeeding" prattle, it is leading nowhere. I fail to see what their comment has to do with the turkey issue, and they only mention a single error, and one ambiguity: "The last sentence is wrongly translated, the original reads “cet oiseau se prend à la course”, meaning “this bird is taken [i.e. captured] by running after it” (as in hare-coursing). Dubois’ “bécasse” has always been translated into English as woodcock (Scolopax rusticola), but oystercatcher (“becasse de mer”, Haematopus ostralegus) is an equally probable gloss; both birds have long straight bills, but the oystercatcher’s is more robust." Therefore, I will add Cheke and Hume's interpretation in the article, not in the translation. We should not meddle with actual sourced content, only comment on it and put it in proper context. <a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 04:25, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<li><b>Provisional impression</b>. I think that this article has some interesting and well presented parts. It also has some parts that are complicated, which I struggle to follow, partly because there are so many facets, names, and drawings in the history of its taxonomy. I am finding this article difficult to evaluate. For me, slightly different versions of text translated from foreign language sources tend to add the the difficulty in evaluating this article. I wonder if anything can be done to make the article easier to read, perhaps by copy-editing the language, re-organising subsections, or adding extra subheadings. If all the images are kept in the article, I wonder if double images would help organise the two ibis photographs and also the two similar Dodo paintings. Is my provisional impression flawed, because of my limitations and idiosyncrasies, or do others share any aspects of my point of view? <a href="User_Snowmanradio" title="User:Snowmanradio">Snowman</a> (<a href="User_talk_Snowmanradio" title="User talk:Snowmanradio">talk</a>) 11:05, 1 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>The thing is, the taxonomic history of the bird <i>is</i> complicated and hard to follow, there's not much we can do about that. As the 2006 book you linked to demonstrates, even modern, professional writers get it utterly wrong. If most details are to be presented and not just glossed over, it inevitably gets convoluted and complex. And even then, there are many details I've left out, to make it even more user friendly. As for old quotes, when the majority of sources use the ones we have here, I think it would be inappropriate to tamper wit them. But if you find more readable, PD translations, sure, be my quest and replace them. And personally, I don't like "double images". The article has plenty of room, no need to stack the images so close to each other. <a href="User_FunkMonk" title="User:FunkMonk">FunkMonk</a> (<a href="User_talk_FunkMonk" title="User talk:FunkMonk">talk</a>) 17:25, 1 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Hi, I explained this to Snowman above, not sure if you saw it, or what you think about the explanation. Schlegel did now know of an ibis, he classified the bird as a species of Dodo in the same article the sketch is from, so retroactively labellingit as the ibis would be kind of misleading, wouldn't it?

<p>So to summarise, I <b>cautiously support</b> on comprehensiveness and prose at this point. I am not seeing any deal-breakers in prose left, I think the use of direct quotes in quote boxes makes the subject alot more engaging to the general reader and I strongly suspect the sources have been investigated thoroughly. I feel the use of "solitaire" has been confined to the area of hte text it is germane to and hopefully is less confusing for the general reader. As a minor formatting issue, it is good to align all refs - so all reference titles should either be in Title Case or sentence case (just choose one and align - given there are German ones Title Case might be better...) <a href="User_Casliber" title="User:Casliber">Casliber</a> (<a href="User_talk_Casliber" title="User talk:Casliber">talk</a> <b>·</b> <a href="Special_Contributions/Casliber" title="Special:Contributions/Casliber">contribs</a>) 02:00, 5 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>What's important is that they are consistent, not necessarily the same. Like J Milburn points out, I use title case for books and sentence case for articles (but title case for the name of the journal, and sentence case for chapters in books) because that seems logical to me.

<dl>
<dd>Yes, it's largely sensible. If I were nitpicking the formatting, I might suggest the following trivialities...
<ul>
<li>the "a" after the colon in ref#4 should be capitalized</li>
<li>the "official title" (i.e. the Worldcat entry obtained from clicking the isbn) of ref#7 doesn't include ": A synopsis on the fossil Rallidae" and could be left out without hindering anyone's ability to find this source</li>
<li>ref#9 is available online <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://si-pddr.si.edu/jspui/bitstream/10088/2005/2/SCtP-0089-Lo_res.pdf">here</a>, so one might include a courtesy link; also, if this proceedings publication has an editor(s), their names are typically included in the citation</li>
<li>if the translated title is included in ref#14, for consistency it should be included with the other foreign language titles as well</li>
<li>I think the "To" in the title of ref#16 should be lower case (there's no set rule about this; see the options at <a href="Title_case#Headings_and_publication_titles" title="Title case" class="mw-redirect">Title_case#Headings_and_publication_titles</a> and be consistent throughout)</li>

<p>Hurricane Debbie in 1961 was one of the most powerful storms to impact Ireland on record. It brought destructive winds in excess of 100 mph to western parts of the country, damaging or destroying many homes and leaving thousands without power. Across the British Isles, 18 people lost their lives and damage exceeded US$50 million. I believe this article qualifies for featured candidate as I have exhausted both free and paid services to obtain the most comprehensive account of this particular hurricane.

<p><b>Support</b>, with the caveat that I reviewed it for GA. That being said, here are some last comments.</p>
<ul>
<li>"during September" - in the opening sentence, should that be changed to "in September"?</li>
<li>"however, operationally," - remove one of these adverbs.</li>
<li>"Once clear of the islands, data on the storm became sparse and it is uncertain what took place with the storm over the following several days as it tracked west-northwestward and later northward." - a comma would be lovely somewhere in here, and maybe change one of the "storm" to "Debbie"</li>
<li>"Maintaining this intensity for over a day" - I think "this" should be something like "its peak", or something, given it's the start of a new paragraph.</li>
<li>Probably self-explanatory, but I think you should clarify somewhere, perhaps as a note, that all damage totals are in that 1961's currency.</li>
<li>"only a handful of which were serious" - handful?&#160;:/</li>
<li>I think the specifics on the fatalities should be in the same paragraph where you mention the death total.</li>
<li>"30,000 trees were felled" - that verb phrasing seems weird to me, but IDK.

<li>HURDAT is not good enough to prove that Debby made landfall in Ireland, since the NOAA report says that Debby skirted around the west coast of Ireland. I also note that the supposed point of landfall is less than 2 km away from the sea, which would suggest to me that it didnt make landfall and just passed near the island.<a href="User_Jason_Rees" title="User:Jason Rees">Jason Rees</a> (<a href="User_talk_Jason_Rees" title="User talk:Jason Rees">talk</a>) 18:21, 13 January 2013 (UTC)

<li><b>Comment</b>. <s>The lead should be expanded to cover the post-decision analysis and any other subsequent developments.

<dl>
<dd>I've done part of the expansion of the lead (still have more to do). As far as the federal-tribal relations, what do you think about my adding a small subsection to subsequent developments, with a {{main}} template to the tribal sovereignty article? <span style="border:1px solid #900;padding:2px;background:#fffff4"><a href="User_GregJackP" title="User:GregJackP"><span style="color:#900;font-size:110%;font-family:Mistral">GregJackP</span></a>&#160;<a href="User_talk_GregJackP" title="User talk:GregJackP"><span style="color:#900;font-size:60%">Boomer!</span></a></span> 01:39, 8 January 2013 (UTC)

<dd><s>I need to clarify my point; I'm referring to federal-tribal relations in terms of the development of law since the 19th century. It seems that the only case discussed before you get to the issue around Lara is <i>Duro</i>. I think you need a subsection under "Background" that covers the changes in this area of the law over time. For example, when the dissent section says "... which referenced prior cases dealing with sovereignty and jurisdiction, from the decision made in United States v. Kagama,[100] to the opinion made in South Dakota v. Bourland", I should have already read <i>some</i> background on what the issues in those cases were. I'm aware this is complex (<small>you have my admiration for attempting this challenge!</small>) but such a section would greatly increase the clarity and readability of this article.

<li>I'm confused. I only checked Dizadar ... this article doesn't seem to be quoting a foreign source (for which NONENG would require a quote in the original language), only paraphrasing it. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 18:44, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Er, did you see the bolded text "When citing a non-English source for information"? The verb "citing" doesn't imply "quoting". --<a href="User_Joy" title="User:Joy">Joy [shallot]</a> (<a href="User_talk_Joy" title="User talk:Joy">talk</a>) 19:40, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Yes, I saw that. What I haven't seen is which information you're challenging, or why. Any good-faith challenge is fine ... if you have reason to believe that something is wrong, you should absolutely say so. But what's not fair is "Policy says you have to provide it if I challenge it, so I'll just go ahead and challenge everything, just in case, without giving a reason". The same issue comes up in <a href="Wikipedia_BURDEN" title="Wikipedia:BURDEN" class="mw-redirect">WP:BURDEN</a> ... information has to be provided if someone challenges it, but that doesn't mean that I have to jump if someone says "I'm challenging everything" without giving a reason. - Dank (<a href="User_talk_Dank" title="User talk:Dank">push to talk</a>) 20:05, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I would never do that. The issue is that the NONENG policy section makes for a different situation - it sets a higher threshold of verifiability on information referenced to foreign sources. The threshold is such that it requires a quote in the foreign language, and sometimes more (a translation). This policy section wasn't in place back when I first arrived, and it isn't uniformly respected across the project, but it makes sense - the standard of verifiability on English-language works is that you have to have enough information to find them and check them, while the standard of verifiability on foreign-language works is that you have to have more than that because it's that much easier to have a source misinterpreted when it's not written in the native language. So, to guard against that, we quote the relevant part of the source. It certainly sounds like something that should be done in a featured article. --<a href="User_Joy" title="User:Joy">Joy [shallot]</a> (<a href="User_talk_Joy" title="User talk:Joy">talk</a>) 20:27, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I'm still not sure what part of the policy requires this (sans challenge). It says, "When citing a non-English source for information, it is not always necessary to provide a translation. However, if a question should arise as to whether the non-English original actually supports the information, relevant portions of the original and a translation should be given in a footnote, as a courtesy." If you are questioning a particular bit of information, please state what it is. If not, with greatest respect I don't think your comment is in accordance with the policy. In any case, I understand you have the requisite language skills, so you know if it is consistent or not. <a href="User_Peacemaker67" title="User:Peacemaker67">Peacemaker67</a> (<a href="User_talk_Peacemaker67#top" title="User talk:Peacemaker67">send... over</a>) 21:48, 25 January 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>You read the second bullet point, but ignored the first one. It requires both the original text and the translation for quotations. The second one, about citations, may seem to be distinct, but it isn't - yes, its phrasing leaves out an explicit mention of providing the original text, but it then implies that it would have been logical to think that it's necessary to provide a translation. The intent seems clear to me - doing both is considered the best. So, a featured article doing neither - doesn't sound right. But, I'll go search the talk page archives there to see if this question came up before. --<a href="User_Joy" title="User:Joy">Joy [shallot]</a> (<a href="User_talk_Joy" title="User talk:Joy">talk</a>) 22:48, 25 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
