Certificate of change of name to Liverpool F.C.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p><a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool F.C.</a> was founded after an internal dispute within <a href="Everton_F.C." title="Everton F.C.">Everton F.C.</a> The dispute was between the Everton F.C. committee and brewer <a href="John_Houlding" title="John Houlding">John Houlding</a>, the landholder of the <a href="Anfield" title="Anfield">Anfield</a> ground and president of Everton F.C.</p>
<p>The Everton committee viewed <a href="Tory" title="Tory">Tory</a> councillor Houlding as having a personal financial and political agenda. There was a sharp conflict on the business model of how the club was run. Relations were cold once the Everton committee saw Houldings intentions and moves.</p>
<p>Anfield was owned by Houlding one year after Everton moved in. Houlding bought the land from landowner Orrell. Everton initially made a donation to a local hospital in lieu of rent. After one year they were paying rent to their own president. Mr Orrell owned the adjacent land.<sup id="cite_ref-LFC_History_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-LFC_History-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Houlding had sole lucrative selling rights on all refreshments at the ground.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_Collins_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy_Collins-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The largely <a href="Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodist</a> based <a href="Liberalism" title="Liberalism">politically Liberal</a> leaning Everton F.C. committee were uneasy with this, especially the potential selling of alcohol. This would take revenue away from the club. Houlding also increased the rent from £100 to £250 per year, after Everton came 2nd in the second Football League season, 1890. Everton offered a compromise of £180. An international match was hosted, <a href="England_national_football_team" title="England national football team">England</a> vs. <a href="Republic_of_Ireland_national_football_team" title="Republic of Ireland national football team">Ireland</a> indicating the quality of Anfield at the time. The rent was not a major issue as the club's profits were substantial. However, from paying a small contribution to a local hospital, Everton five years later was paying £250, a substantial sum in those days.</p>
<p>The flashpoint came when Orrell wanted to legally run a road through the new main stand to access his land. This entailed Everton buying Anfield and Orrell's land or renting both. Everton members accused Houlding of knowing of the legal right of way and allowing the new stand to be built. If renting Everton would be dealing with two different landlords. Orrell's land Everton F.C. did not need, but being forced to rent or buy it. The Everton committee were wanting Houlding to negotiate on the combined Anfield and Orrell's land rent of £370 or the purchase of both plots of land. Houdling and Orrell stated the £370 was non-negotiable. Houlding stood to make a killing on selling Anfield to Everton, if the club bought his land. Houlding did not negotiate with Everton who had already made a plan to move to <a href="Goodison_Park" title="Goodison Park">Goodison Park</a> on the north side of <a href="../../w/index-title=Stanley_Park_(Liverpool)&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Stanley Park (Liverpool) (page does not exist)">Stanley Park</a>. After Houlding attempted to hijack the club undiplomatically serving a notice to quit to force their hand, Everton enacted their plan to move to Goodison Park.<sup id="cite_ref-Kennedy_Collins_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Kennedy_Collins-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-Creation_of_Liverpool_FC_3-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Creation_of_Liverpool_FC-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The original name of Liverpool F.C. was <i>Everton F.C. and Athletic Grounds, Ltd.</i>, or <i>Everton Athletic</i> for short, adopting blue. The Athletic in the name was to fulfil Houlding's plan to make Anfield into a football and athletics ground, which never materialised.</p>
<p>However, on the 4th of February, 1892, the Football Council decided that it would not approve the creation of another club named Everton, on the basis that the name bears resemblance to an existing member. Liverpool F.C. was formally established on 15 March 1892, while Everton were still occupying and playing at Anfield, in an attempt by Houdling to hijack the club. Houlding wanted to take over Everton's fixtures and position in the Football League. Liverpool F.C. and Athletic Grounds Ltd was officially recognized by the Football Council in June 1892, three months after the club was established.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The root of the dispute was fundamental differences of ownership. Houlding wanted ownership to be within a small group of people, giving annual returns. The Everton Committee wanted a large spread of ownership, via shares, as it was viewed as a community club.

<p><i>Honours won: League Championship (1947)</i></p>
<p><a href="George_Kay" title="George Kay">George Kay</a> was recruited from <a href="Southampton_F.C." title="Southampton F.C.">Southampton</a> in June 1936, to replace <a href="George_Patterson_(football)" title="George Patterson (football)">George Patterson</a>, who was unable to continue the managerial side of his role. Kay's career as Liverpool manager started poorly, with only three wins and four draws from the first twelve matches. This run included a 2–6 defeat at <a href="Portsmouth_F.C." title="Portsmouth F.C.">Portsmouth</a>'s <a href="Fratton_Park" title="Fratton Park">Fratton Park</a> on 2 September and a 2–5 defeat at <a href="Brentford_F.C." title="Brentford F.C.">Brentford</a>; the only bright spot in this spell was a 7–1 victory over <a href="Grimsby_Town_F.C." title="Grimsby Town F.C.">Grimsby Town</a> on 12 September, with two goals from <a href="Fred_Howe" title="Fred Howe">Fred Howe</a>. Results improved slightly as the season progressed and Liverpool finished Kay's <a href="1936%E2%80%9337_in_English_football" title="1936–37 in English football">first season</a> in charge in 18th place in Division 1.</p>
<p>Despite the set-back of an opening day 1–6 defeat at <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a>'s <a href="Stamford_Bridge_(stadium)" title="Stamford Bridge (stadium)">Stamford Bridge</a>, Liverpool finished the <a href="1937%E2%80%9338_in_English_football" title="1937–38 in English football">1937–38 season</a> comfortably in mid-table, with <a href="Alf_Hanson" title="Alf Hanson">Alf Hanson</a> top scorer on 14 league goals. In the <a href="1938%E2%80%9339_in_English_football" title="1938–39 in English football">following season</a>, Liverpool again finished in 11th position in the table, with <a href="Berry_Nieuwenhuys" title="Berry Nieuwenhuys">Berry Nieuwenhuys</a>, <a href="Willie_Fagan" title="Willie Fagan">Willie Fagan</a> and <a href="Phil_Taylor_(footballer)" title="Phil Taylor (footballer)">Phil Taylor</a> joint top scorers in the league with 14 goals each.</p>
<p>In readiness for the next season, Kay snapped up young defender <a href="Bob_Paisley" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> on a free transfer from <a href="Bishop_Auckland_F.C." title="Bishop Auckland F.C.">Bishop Auckland</a>, as well as another future Liverpool legend <a href="Billy_Liddell" title="Billy Liddell">Billy Liddell</a>, but all their careers were then interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.</p>
<p>After the war, the club took the unusual decision to tour the United States and Canada. It was Kay's theory that the climate and diet in North America would be extremely beneficial to the players. The punishing schedule of 10 matches in less than a month meant that the Liverpool squad started <a href="1946%E2%80%9347_in_English_football" title="1946–47 in English football">the first post-war season</a> in far better physical shape than many of their competitors.</p>
<p>The season started slowly, with four victories and three defeats in the first seven games. The victories included a 7–4 match against <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea</a> on 7 September, in which <a href="Bob_Paisley" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> made his league debut for the club and Billy Liddell scored his first league goal. There was also a 5–0 defeat away to <a href="Manchester_United_F.C." title="Manchester United F.C.">Manchester United</a> (played at <a href="Maine_Road" title="Maine Road">Maine Road</a>). Things began to improve and a run of seven consecutive victories in February and March set the club on the way to the championship.</p>
<p>Liverpool had a long run in the FA Cup, eventually going out to <a href="Burnley_F.C." title="Burnley F.C.">Burnley</a> in the semi-final, after a replay. The club did, however, pick up the Lancashire Senior Cup, Lancashire County Combination Championship Cup and <a href="Liverpool_Senior_Cup" title="Liverpool Senior Cup">Liverpool Senior Cup</a> along the way.</p>
<p>As the season reached its climax, several clubs were still in contention and on 31 May 1947 Liverpool went to <a href="Molineux_Stadium" title="Molineux Stadium">Molineux</a> to meet the leaders, <a href="Wolverhampton_Wanderers_F.C." title="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.">Wolverhampton Wanderers</a> needing to win to take the championship, as well as other results going in their favour. Liverpool won the match 2–1, other results went their way and the Reds were champions of the Football League for a fifth time. It was George Kay's finest moment as a football manager.</p>
<p>Top scorers in the Championship season were <a href="Jack_Balmer" title="Jack Balmer">Jack Balmer</a> and <a href="Albert_Stubbins" title="Albert Stubbins">Albert Stubbins</a> with 24 league goals each. They continued to be prolific scorers during Kay's period in charge but the club was unable to come close to another championship, finishing each of the next three seasons in the lower part of the top half of the table. In 1950, they reached the <a href="FA_Cup_Final_1950" title="FA Cup Final 1950" class="mw-redirect">FA Cup final</a> for the first time in 36 years, but the match at <a href="Wembley_Stadium_(1923)" title="Wembley Stadium (1923)">Wembley</a> ended in a 2–0 victory for <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a>.</p>

<p><i>Honours won: -</i></p>
<p>Don Welsh succeeded George Kay as Liverpool manager in 1951. He had played for Liverpool during the Second World War as a guest, and had also won the FA Cup with Charlton in 1947. Unfortunately for Welsh, he inherited a team that was coming to the end of its time. After spending on some new players such as <a href="Alan_A'Court" title="Alan A'Court">Alan A'Court</a>, Welsh could not prevent the team from sliding down the table and into relegation for the first time in over 50 years.</p>
<p>Liverpool almost made it back to Division 1 in 1956. However despite that close result, Welsh was not to be given another chance and was sacked in 1956, the first time this had happened to a Liverpool manager in 64 years of existence. He was replaced by <a href="Phil_Taylor_(football)" title="Phil Taylor (football)" class="mw-redirect">Phil Taylor</a>.</p>

<p>Phil Taylor took over as Liverpool boss in 1956 after the sacking of Don Welsh. He was immediately given the task of leading Liverpool to promotion back to Division 1. Taylor soon found the pressure of getting Liverpool back into the top division almost intolerable. The club finished third in 1957 and a fourth place followed that in 1958.</p>
<p>In January 1959 Liverpool suffered their most humiliating defeat when they were knocked out of the FA Cup by non-League <a href="Worcester_City_F.C." title="Worcester City F.C.">Worcester City</a>.

<p>Shankly's 55-year-old assistant <a href="Bob_Paisley" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a> was promoted to the position of <a href="Coach_(sport)" title="Coach (sport)">manager</a> for the 1974–75 season after failing to persuade his predecessor to carry on. Paisley was manager of Liverpool from 1974 until 1983, and during those nine years he became one of the most successful managers ever to take charge of an English club. His one and only season without winning a trophy was his first, 1974–75.</p>
<p>Paisley's second season brought the league title (the first of six under his management). In 1977 the championship was retained and the team won the European Cup for the first time in the club's history. The final was won with 3–1 over old foes Borussia Mönchengladbach.<sup id="cite_ref-bennett_14-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bennett-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> This game in Rome was Kevin Keegan's last for the club. The European Cup was retained the following year with a 1–0 win in the final against <a href="Club_Brugge_K.V." title="Club Brugge K.V.">F.C. Brugge</a> with the goal scored by <a href="Kenny_Dalglish" title="Kenny Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-bennett_14-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bennett-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Keegan's replacement. Dalglish had been put through by future captain <a href="Graeme_Souness" title="Graeme Souness">Graeme Souness</a>.</p>
<p>1978–79 was a record breaking year as the league title was won with 68 points and only 16 goals conceded in 42 matches.<sup id="cite_ref-paisley_15-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-paisley-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The following season brought another league title. Paisley's third and last European Cup victory came in 1981 with a 1–0 victory in the final over <a href="Real_Madrid" title="Real Madrid" class="mw-redirect">Real Madrid</a>. The unexpected scorer of the winning goal was defender <a href="Alan_Kennedy" title="Alan Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-bennett_14-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-bennett-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The only domestic trophy to previously elude them, <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="Football League Cup">the League Cup</a>, was also won that season with another defender, <a href="Alan_Hansen" title="Alan Hansen">Alan Hansen</a>, grabbing the winning goal.</p>
<p>A defeat to <a href="Manchester_City" title="Manchester City" class="mw-redirect">Manchester City</a> on <a href="Boxing_Day" title="Boxing Day">Boxing Day</a> 1981 saw Liverpool drop to eleventh place, and their opponents went top of the league on that day, but a string of victories brought the title back to Anfield. Ironically, they sealed the title on the final day of the season with a 1–0 home win over Manchester City, who in contrast had suffered a terrible run of form in the second half of the season and slumped to 12th place. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=19&Month=May&ssnno=110&teamno=342">[2]</a></p>
<p>The League Cup was also retained, with a 3–2 win over FA Cup winners <a href="Tottenham_Hotspur" title="Tottenham Hotspur" class="mw-redirect">Tottenham Hotspur</a> in extra time. Young midfielder <a href="Ronnie_Whelan" title="Ronnie Whelan">Ronnie Whelan</a> scored twice, with the other goal coming from emerging striker <a href="Ian_Rush" title="Ian Rush">Ian Rush</a> who had signed from <a href="Chester_City_F.C." title="Chester City F.C.">Chester</a> two years earlier but only that season broke into the first team. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverweb.org.uk/proglc.htm">[3]</a></p>
<p><a href="1982%E2%80%9383_in_English_football" title="1982–83 in English football">1982–83</a> saw Liverpool retain the league title and also the League Cup. They faced some stiff competition early on, but by the end of February the title race was effectively over. The title was clinched with four games remaining. A unique third successive League Cup triumph had been secured on 26 March when goals from <a href="Alan_Kennedy" title="Alan Kennedy">Alan Kennedy</a> and <a href="Ronnie_Whelan" title="Ronnie Whelan">Ronnie Whelan</a> gave them a 2–1 win over Manchester United in the final at <a href="Wembley_Stadium_(1923)" title="Wembley Stadium (1923)">Wembley Stadium</a>.</p>
<p>Such was the success of Liverpool, who won six of the nine league titles they contested for during Paisley's management, that the manager himself once quoted: <i>Mind you, I've been here during the bad times too – one year we came second.</i><a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-1279994/THE-LIST-Top-50-managerial-quotes-time-Nos-10-1.html">[4]</a></p>
<p>The big question for fans at the conclusion of that season was who would replace <a href="Bob_Paisley" title="Bob Paisley">Bob Paisley</a>. Before retiring he won a total of twenty-one trophies, including three European Cups, a UEFA Cup, six league titles and three consecutive League Cups during his spell as manager. Under Paisley, a new era of stars emerged. They included Graeme Souness, Ian Rush, Alan Hansen and <a href="Kenny_Dalglish" title="Kenny Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a>.</p>

<p>Liverpool made a slow start to the <a href="1984%E2%80%9385_in_English_football" title="1984–85 in English football">1984–85</a> season, <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Sep&ssnno=114&teamno=342">[8]</a>, but by Christmas had climbed up to fifth place <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=21&Month=Dec&ssnno=114&teamno=342">[9]</a>. Liverpool eventually finished second behind Everton. Their FA Cup run was ended at the semi-final stage on 17 April when they lost 2–1 to Manchester United after a replay. On the continental scene, Liverpool had booked their place in the European Cup final for the fifth time in their history. They were drawn to play <a href="Juventus" title="Juventus" class="mw-redirect">Juventus</a> of Italy at the <a href="Heysel_Stadium" title="Heysel Stadium" class="mw-redirect">Heysel Stadium</a> in <a href="Brussels" title="Brussels">Brussels</a>, Belgium on 29 May 1985.

<p>Liverpool supporters broke down a dividing fence and charged the Juventus supporters resulting in the <a href="Heysel_Stadium_disaster" title="Heysel Stadium disaster">death of 39 people</a> who were crushed to death when a wall collapsed.

<p>Fagan handed over the reins to striker Kenny Dalglish, who had established himself as a world class player and now wanted to prove himself as a manager.</p>
<p>By the end of September the league table was being led by Manchester United (who had won all of their first 10 league games), with Liverpool nine points behind in second place. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=28&Month=Sep&ssnno=115&teamno=342">[10]</a> By Christmas, however, the gap between Liverpool and United had been narrowed to four points, with Everton – along with surprise title challengers West Ham United, Chelsea and Sheffield Wednesday – close behind. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=21&Month=Dec&ssnno=115&teamno=342">[11]</a>. A home defeat by league leaders Everton in late February left Liverpool with an eight point gap to close. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=22&Month=Feb&ssnno=115&teamno=342">[12]</a> Eleven wins and a draw in the last twelve matches, meant the league title was finally sealed on the last day of the season as they won 1–0 at Chelsea. The winning goal by Kenny Dalglish ensured they finished two points ahead of runners-up Everton. Hopes of a unique domestic treble ended on 5 March when Liverpool were edged out of the League Cup in the semi-finals by Queen's Park Rangers, one of the First Division's least fancied sides. However, their FA Cup run, which included three victories after extra time, put Liverpool in the FA Cup final – where they took on Everton on 10 May. An early goal by <a href="Gary_Lineker" title="Gary Lineker">Gary Lineker</a> gave the blue half of <a href="Merseyside" title="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> the lead, but the tables turned in the second half as <a href="Ian_Rush" title="Ian Rush">Ian Rush</a> scored twice and <a href="Craig_Johnston" title="Craig Johnston">Craig Johnston</a> hit the other goal as Liverpool ran out 3–1 winners to become only the third club of the 20th century (and the fifth since the formation of the <a href="Football_League" title="Football League" class="mw-redirect">Football League</a> in 1888) to win the league title and FA Cup in the same season. It was a perfect first season in management for Kenny Dalglish, marred only by the fact that <a href="UEFA" title="UEFA">UEFA</a> had voted for the ban on English clubs in European competitions to continue into the 1986–87 season, so there was no question of Liverpool being able to challenge for another European Cup triumph.</p>
<p><a href="1986%E2%80%9387_in_English_football" title="1986–87 in English football">1986–87</a> saw Liverpool face competition from an even bigger number of clubs for the league title, which they had now won 16 times. Wimbledon, playing their first season as a First Division club and only their tenth in the <a href="Football_League" title="Football League" class="mw-redirect">Football League</a>, were the leaders in early September, with Liverpool fifth. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=03&Month=Sep&ssnno=116&teamno=342">[13]</a> They were still fifth at the end of October with Nottingham Forest leading the way. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=25&Month=Oct&ssnno=116&teamno=342">[14]</a>. On Boxing Day 1986 Liverpool suffered their only league home defeat of the season – 1–0 to Manchester United, leaving Liverpool fourth in the league and seven points behind leaders Arsenal, who after a few lean seasons were being rejuvenated impressively by new manager <a href="George_Graham_(footballer)" title="George Graham (footballer)">George Graham</a>. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=26&Month=Dec&ssnno=116&teamno=342">[15]</a> Late January saw Liverpool fall victim to one of the biggest shock results of the season, when they lost 3–0 to Luton Town (a First Division team but one still lacking a major trophy to their name) in an FA Cup third round, second replay. However, the first hurdle exit from the FA Cup gave them more time to concentrate on their league title challenge, and by the end of February they were level on points with Everton at the top of the league, with Arsenal still pushing them hard – along with surprise title challengers Luton Town and Norwich City. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=28&Month=Feb&ssnno=116&teamno=342">[16]</a></p>
<p>Before the season began, star striker Ian Rush had decided to move to <a href="Juventus" title="Juventus" class="mw-redirect">Juventus</a> at the end of the campaign in a £3.2million deal. Rush was still one of the highest scorers in the league, but with player-manager Dalglish knowing that his playing days were numbered, and being doubtful of fellow striker <a href="Paul_Walsh" title="Paul Walsh">Paul Walsh</a>'s ability to be Liverpool's main striker, he made a mid-season move for 28-year-old <a href="Oxford_United" title="Oxford United" class="mw-redirect">Oxford United</a> striker <a href="John_Aldridge" title="John Aldridge">John Aldridge</a>, who partnered Rush until the end of the season.</p>
<p>Liverpool also reached the <a href="1987_Football_League_Cup_Final" title="1987 Football League Cup Final">League Cup final</a> that season, but lost 2–1 to Arsenal.</p>
<p>Liverpool were clear leaders of the First Division by mid March 1987. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=18&Month=Mar&ssnno=116&teamno=342">[17]</a> However, an uncharacteristic run of five defeats in the final nine games of the season let in challengers, Everton. A 1–0 defeat to Coventry City on 2 May effectively ended Liverpool's title bid, and Everton won their game the next day to ensure that the Anfield boardroom was left without a trophy for only the second season in a decade.</p>
<p>Rush departed to Juventus when the season ended, but the 1987 close season saw two high profile signings by Kenny Dalglish, who paid a national record £1.9million for Newcastle United and England striker <a href="Peter_Beardsley" title="Peter Beardsley">Peter Beardsley</a> and a further £900,000 for Beardsley's England team mate <a href="John_Barnes_(footballer)" title="John Barnes (footballer)">John Barnes</a> from Watford to complete a new-look attack to combine with John Aldridge.</p>
<p>UEFA once again voted for the ban on English clubs in European competitions to continue for at least another season, meaning that Liverpool would not be able to compete in the <a href="1987%E2%80%9388_UEFA_Cup" title="1987–88 UEFA Cup">1987–88 UEFA Cup</a>. Indeed, the recommendation that they should serve an extra three years once the ban had been lifted on other English clubs made it seem likely that Liverpool's European isolation would now continue into the 1990s.</p>
<p><a href="1987%E2%80%9388_in_English_football" title="1987–88 in English football">1987–88</a> would prove to be one of the greatest seasons in Liverpool's history. Repairs to the terraces at the Kop end meant that Liverpool did not play a home match until 12 September. The consequent games in hand on the teams around them helped <a href="Jim_Smith_(footballer)" title="Jim Smith (footballer)">Jim Smith's</a> Queen's Park Rangers to the top of the league at the end of September. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Sep&ssnno=117&teamno=342">[18]</a> But by Christmas Liverpool remained unbeaten and were seven points clear of nearest rivals Arsenal. It wasn't until 20 March that their record 29-match unbeaten start to the league season was ended, and even then it mattered little as Liverpool were 14 points ahead of their nearest rivals (a resurgent Manchester United). <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=20&Month=Mar&ssnno=117&teamno=342">[19]</a> They put their title win beyond all doubt on St George's Day with a 1–0 win over Tottenham Hotspur at Anfield. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=117&teamno=342">[20]</a>. John Aldridge was the First Division's leading goalscorer with twenty five goals, whilst John Barnes and Beardsley also featured in the top ten with fifteen goals apiece. The new forward line was undoubtedly the most formidable in the league.</p>
<p>Liverpool also reached the <a href="1989_FA_Cup_Final" title="1989 FA Cup Final">FA Cup final that season</a>, taking on <a href="Wimbledon_F.C." title="Wimbledon F.C.">Wimbledon</a> – one of the league's newest members, having completed only their 11th season as a Football League side and their second as First Division members. Wimbledon produced a major shock as they won 1-0 through a header from midfielder <a href="Lawrie_Sanchez" title="Lawrie Sanchez">Lawrie Sanchez</a>. The game was also notable for the first ever penalty to be missed in an FA Cup Final - <a href="John_Aldridge" title="John Aldridge">John Aldridge</a>'s 61st minute being saved by Wimbledon keeper <a href="Dave_Beasant" title="Dave Beasant">Dave Beasant</a>.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.thefa.com/TheFACup/FACompetitions/TheFACup/History/HistoryOfTheFACup/1988WimbledonLiverpool.aspx">[21]</a> Liverpool were denied what would have been their second double in three seasons.</p>
<p>UEFA then voted for the ban on all English clubs in European competitions to continue for a fourth season, meaning that Liverpool once again missed out on the chance of another European Cup bid.</p>
<p><a href="Ian_Rush" title="Ian Rush">Ian Rush</a> returned to Liverpool for the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389_in_English_football" title="1988–89 in English football">1988–89</a> season for a national record fee of £2.8million, after a frustrating spell at <a href="Juventus" title="Juventus" class="mw-redirect">Juventus</a>. His return sparked rumours about the future of John Aldridge and Peter Beardsley, with it seeming possible that one of these players would be forced out of the club by the return of Rush. But it did not quite happen that way. Dalglish decided to operate a <a href="4-3-3" title="4-3-3" class="mw-redirect">4-3-3</a> formation so Rush could play alongside both of these players, though a series of niggling injuries hindered him and he was restricted to seven goals from 24 First Division games in his first campaign back on Merseyside.</p>
<p>Rush's slightly less than rip-roaring start to his second Anfield spell was symbolic of Liverpool's unremarkable form. Only at the beginning of March did a sequence of winning results bring them into contention for the title. Even by the end of that month they were still five points off the top of the league, now standing third behind leaders Arsenal and second placed Norwich City. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=29&Month=Mar&ssnno=118&teamno=342">[22]</a></p>
<p>One of the worst tragedies ever to hit sport occurred on 15 April 1989. Liverpool travelled to <a href="Hillsborough_Stadium" title="Hillsborough Stadium">Hillsborough Stadium</a> for the FA Cup semi-final where they took on Nottingham Forest. Just six minutes into the game, play was halted as it became evident that fans were being crushed in the overcrowded Leppings Lane end of the ground. Fans were pouring over the security fences in an attempt to escape the mayhem, and before long it was becoming clear that people were being seriously injured and possibly even killed. 94 fans died that day in a tragedy which soon became simply known as <a href="Hillsborough_disaster" title="Hillsborough disaster">"Hillsborough"</a>. A 95th victim died in hospital from his injuries four days later. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/15/newsid_2491000/2491195.stm">[23]</a> The death toll became 96 in March 1993, when <a href="Tony_Bland" title="Tony Bland">Tony Bland</a> died after being in a <a href="Coma" title="Coma">coma</a> for nearly four years. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/19/newsid_2520000/2520581.stm">[24]</a> Liverpool players and staff were commended for their behaviour in the aftermath of the tragedy.</p>
<p>For a while it seemed as though the <a href="1988%E2%80%9389_FA_Cup" title="1988–89 FA Cup">1988–89 FA Cup campaign</a> would be cancelled, but the FA soon decided that the competition would go on. The semi-final was played again at <a href="Old_Trafford" title="Old Trafford">Old Trafford</a> three weeks later. Liverpool defeated Nottingham Forest 3–1 to book a place in the final against Everton – the second Merseyside FA Cup final in four seasons. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadtmrs.asp?ssnno=118&teamno=342">[25]</a> Liverpool's resurgence in the league had continued, and a 5–1 win over relegation bound West Ham United in the penultimate game of the season saw them open up a three point lead over Arsenal. Ironically, Arsenal were their opponents for the <a href="Liverpool_0%E2%80%932_Arsenal_(26_May_1989)" title="Liverpool 0–2 Arsenal (26 May 1989)">final league game of the season</a> at Anfield, and would have to win by at least two clear goals to deprive Liverpool of a unique second double. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=23&Month=May&ssnno=118&teamno=342">[26]</a> As the game entered its final minute, Arsenal were leading 1–0 but that would be enough to keep the league title at Anfield and see Liverpool make history, but with only seconds remaining Arsenal midfielder <a href="Michael_Thomas_(footballer_born_1967)" title="Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)">Michael Thomas</a> scored the dramatic goal that saw the league title head to <a href="Arsenal_Stadium" title="Arsenal Stadium">Highbury</a> for the first time since 1971. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.arsenal.com/news/news-archive/gunners-greatest-players-37.-michael-thomas">[27]</a></p>
<p>UEFA voted for the ban on English clubs to continue into the 1989–90 season, and so Liverpool were unable to make a challenge for the <a href="UEFA_Cup_Winners'_Cup" title="UEFA Cup Winners' Cup">UEFA Cup Winners' Cup</a>.</p>
<p><a href="1989%E2%80%9390_in_English_football" title="1989–90 in English football">1989–90</a> began with much anticipation about the season that lay ahead and who would be challenging for the honours. Liverpool and Arsenal were the inevitable title favourites of many observers, but teams like Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur were also mentioned as possible contenders following a series of high profile signings. Liverpool began the season well enough, but a 4–1 defeat at Southampton on 21 October saw them fall into second place behind Everton, who were making a serious bid for the title after two seasons of relatively mediocre form. Southampton were also emerging as surprise title contenders, as were Arsenal, although the much anticipated challenge from Manchester United was not emerging. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=21&Month=Oct&ssnno=119&teamno=342">[28]</a></p>
<p>As the decade ended, Liverpool were leading the First Division with a four-point margin over Aston Villa, now managed by <a href="Graham_Taylor_(footballer)" title="Graham Taylor (footballer)" class="mw-redirect">Graham Taylor</a> who at his former club Watford had so nearly pipped Liverpool to the title seven years earlier. The challenge by Everton, in contrast, had ebbed away as their local rivals had slumped from top to 10th in just two months. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=30&Month=Dec&ssnno=119&teamno=342">[29]</a></p>
<p>By April 1990, Aston Villa had briefly overtaken Liverpool in the league and Kenny Dalglish's men had also suffered a surprise FA Cup semi-final exit at the hands of unfancied Crystal Palace, but in the end they secured their 18th league title by a nine-point margin. <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.liverpool-mad.co.uk/footydb/loadgen.asp?Day=05&Month=May&ssnno=119&teamno=342">[30]</a></p>
<p>Such was Liverpool's dominance of the domestic scene from 1985 to 1990 that they were the only English clubs who would have qualified for a European competition in each of the seasons that all English clubs were isolated from Europe.</p>
<p>On 22 February 1991, with Liverpool halfway through a two-horse race with Arsenal for the league title and the day after an epic 4–4 FA Cup clash with Everton (a game which saw their rivals come back from a goal down 4 times), Kenny Dalglish dropped a bombshell by handing in his resignation as manager, claiming he could no longer cope with the pressure of managing the club. First-team coach <a href="Ronnie_Moran" title="Ronnie Moran">Ronnie Moran</a> took charge of team affairs for several weeks before <a href="Graeme_Souness" title="Graeme Souness">Graeme Souness</a> was named as the club's new manager. Top of the table when Dalglish quit, Liverpool were now slipping behind in the title race and finished runners-up to Arsenal who completed the season with just one defeat from 38 games.</p>
<p>1990–91 also saw the retirement of club captain <a href="Alan_Hansen" title="Alan Hansen">Alan Hansen</a> after a careering spanning nearly 20 years – the final 14 of which had been spent at Anfield.</p>
<p>It was also the final season at the club for Peter Beardsley, who after four years at Anfield crossed <a href="Stanley_Park" title="Stanley Park">Stanley Park</a> in a £1million move to Everton. 1990–91 saw the arrival of young midfielder <a href="Jamie_Redknapp" title="Jamie Redknapp">Jamie Redknapp</a> and the debut of fellow midfielder <a href="Steve_McManaman" title="Steve McManaman">Steve McManaman</a>. Both of these players would go on to play a major part in Liverpool's performances throughout the 1990s. In June 1991, Liverpool paid £2.9million (a national record) for <a href="Derby_County_F.C." title="Derby County F.C.">Derby County</a> striker <a href="Dean_Saunders" title="Dean Saunders">Dean Saunders</a> and £2.5million for his team mate, England defender <a href="Mark_Wright_(footballer_born_1963)" title="Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)">Mark Wright</a>, as Souness looked to achieve title glory at Anfield as a manager just as he had done as a player.</p>

<p><a href="Graeme_Souness" title="Graeme Souness">Graeme Souness</a> had a reasonable start to his career as Liverpool <a href="Coach_(sport)" title="Coach (sport)">manager</a>.

He sold several good players such as <a href="Ray_Houghton" title="Ray Houghton">Ray Houghton</a>, and <a href="Steve_Staunton" title="Steve Staunton">Steve Staunton</a> and spent recklessly on expensive new players like the £2million spent on <a href="Paul_Stewart_(footballer_born_1964)" title="Paul Stewart (footballer born 1964)">Paul Stewart</a>, <a href="Torben_Piechnik" title="Torben Piechnik">Torben Piechnik</a> and <a href="Istv%C3%A1n_Kozma_(footballer)" title="István Kozma (footballer)">Istvan Kozma</a>. None of these players were particularly successful, with both Piechnik and Kozma gone within two years, and Stewart lasting nearly four years although he had not played for two years before his departure.</p>
<p>While <a href="Michael_Thomas_(footballer_born_1967)" title="Michael Thomas (footballer born 1967)">Michael Thomas</a> and <a href="Mark_Wright_(footballer_born_1963)" title="Mark Wright (footballer born 1963)">Mark Wright</a> were signed for 1.5m and 2.2m respectively, however, they spent most of the time under Souness's tenure at Liverpool on the sidelines injured.

One of the most bizarre transfers was the signing of striker <a href="Dean_Saunders" title="Dean Saunders">Dean Saunders</a> for a British transfer record of £2.9million from <a href="Derby_County_F.C." title="Derby County F.C.">Derby County</a> in the summer of 1991. He proved to be a success alongside fellow Welshman <a href="Ian_Rush" title="Ian Rush">Ian Rush</a> up front but after only six matches into the 1992–1993 season, he was surprisingly sold onto Aston Villa for £2.5million, making a loss of £400,000.</p>
<p>The youth team coached by Liverpool legend <a href="Steve_Heighway" title="Steve Heighway">Steve Heighway</a> produced several players for the first team, like <a href="Robbie_Fowler" title="Robbie Fowler">Robbie Fowler</a>, <a href="Dominic_Matteo" title="Dominic Matteo">Dominic Matteo</a> and <a href="Steve_McManaman" title="Steve McManaman">Steve McManaman</a>, while two of Daglish's last signings, <a href="Jamie_Redknapp" title="Jamie Redknapp">Jamie Redknapp</a> and <a href="Don_Hutchison" title="Don Hutchison">Don Hutchison</a>, broke into the first team under Souness. However Hutchinson was sold on after several disciplinary problems. The veteran striker Ian Rush meanwhile, was still scoring goals as freely as ever despite being in his thirties. Long-serving goalkeeper <a href="Bruce_Grobbelaar" title="Bruce Grobbelaar">Bruce Grobbelaar</a> was often being kept out of the team by promising young shot-stopper David James.</p>
<p>Liverpool finished sixth in the first-ever <a href="../F.A._Premier_League" title="F.A. Premier League" class="mw-redirect">F.A. Premier League</a> and never looked like title challengers at any stage during the season, occupying a lowly 15th place in the table as late as March. In the summer the coach pinned his hopes for the new season on two players, current England international <a href="Nigel_Clough" title="Nigel Clough">Nigel Clough</a> signed for £2.275m from relegated <a href="Nottingham_Forest" title="Nottingham Forest" class="mw-redirect">Nottingham Forest</a> and central defender <a href="Neil_Ruddock" title="Neil Ruddock">Neil Ruddock</a> for £2.5million from <a href="Tottenham_Hotspur" title="Tottenham Hotspur" class="mw-redirect">Tottenham Hotspur</a>.</p>
<p>The duo fitted in perfectly into Souness's <a href="Formation_(football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-4-2</a> formation, and in the first game of the season against <a href="Sheffield_Wednesday" title="Sheffield Wednesday" class="mw-redirect">Sheffield Wednesday</a>, Clough bagged a double in a 2–0 victory, and then scored a goal from a beautifully executed backheel at <a href="Loftus_Road" title="Loftus Road">Loftus Road</a> in a 3–1 win over <a href="Queens_Park_Rangers_F.C." title="Queens Park Rangers F.C.">QPR</a>, and then Souness's team trashed Premier League newcomers <a href="Swindon_Town" title="Swindon Town" class="mw-redirect">Swindon Town</a> 5–0 with <a href="Neil_Ruddock" title="Neil Ruddock">Neil Ruddock</a> netting his first goal. However that was as good as it got, as Liverpool despite taking the lead with Clough's four goal in his first match for the Reds, lost 2–1 to Tottenham at Anfield. Liverpool did beat <a href="Leeds_United" title="Leeds United" class="mw-redirect">Leeds United</a> 2–0 in the following match but two 1–0 defeats to <a href="Coventry_City" title="Coventry City" class="mw-redirect">Coventry City</a>, and <a href="Blackburn_Rovers" title="Blackburn Rovers" class="mw-redirect">Blackburn Rovers</a> clearly showed that nothing had changed from the previous season. It all come to ahead in the <a href="Merseyside" title="Merseyside">Merseyside</a> derby in the next match, when <a href="Steve_McManaman" title="Steve McManaman">Steve McManaman</a> and <a href="Bruce_Grobbelaar" title="Bruce Grobbelaar">Bruce Grobbelaar</a> got into a scuffle during the match. The team was in disarray and the title looked further than ever. On <a href="Match_of_the_Day" title="Match of the Day">Match of the Day</a>, Alan Hansen pinpointed the weakness in Nigel Clough in tackles and winning the ball back as one of the problems. The striker's form dipped and he was played in midfield as emerging youngster <a href="Robbie_Fowler" title="Robbie Fowler">Robbie Fowler</a> was given his first start in the <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="Football League Cup">Football League Cup</a> match against <a href="Fulham_F.C." title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a>, in which he scored in a 3–1 victory. In the return leg at Anfield, he scored all five goals in a 5–0 rout. To instill some strength in the Liverpool ranks, Souness signed full-back <a href="Julian_Dicks" title="Julian Dicks">Julian Dicks</a> from West Ham, costing £1.6m with <a href="David_Burrows_(footballer)" title="David Burrows (footballer)">David Burrows</a> and <a href="Mike_Marsh_(footballer)" title="Mike Marsh (footballer)">Mike Marsh</a> moving in the other direction.</p>
<p>In the end, Liverpool were dumped out of the League Cup by Wimbledon on penalties. The FA Cup seemed to be Liverpool's only hope of silverware that season, and were drawn against <a href="Bristol_City_F.C." title="Bristol City F.C.">Bristol City</a>. The first match was played at <a href="Ashton_Gate" title="Ashton Gate">Ashton Gate</a>, where Fowler nearly scored with his backside after a miskick from the City keeper. Ian Rush scored for the Reds, and <a href="Wayne_Allison" title="Wayne Allison">Wayne Allison</a> scored for the opposition; however, floodlight failure meant the match had to be played again. It finished 1–1 again, with the same players scoring for their respective clubs and a replay was scheduled for Anfield.

Evans was determined to get his players into shape, and in the club's first game of the season, they trashed Crystal Palace 6–1 at <a href="Selhurst_Park" title="Selhurst Park">Selhurst Park</a>, a result that vindicated the manager's decision not to buy big over the summer. The manager lined up with a <a href="Formation_(football)#4.E2.80.934.E2.80.932" title="Formation (football)" class="mw-redirect">4-4-2</a> formation with <a href="David_James_(footballer)" title="David James (footballer)">David James</a>, right back <a href="Rob_Jones_(footballer_born_1971)" title="Rob Jones (footballer born 1971)">Rob Jones</a>, left back <a href="Stig_Inge_Bj%C3%B8rnebye" title="Stig Inge Bjørnebye">Stig Inge Bjørnebye</a>, centre back <a href="Steve_Nicol" title="Steve Nicol">Steve Nicol</a>, centre back <a href="Neil_Ruddock" title="Neil Ruddock">Neil Ruddock</a>, centre midfield <a href="John_Barnes_(footballer)" title="John Barnes (footballer)">John Barnes</a>, right wing <a href="Steve_McManaman" title="Steve McManaman">Steve McManaman</a>, centre midfield <a href="Jan_M%C3%B8lby" title="Jan Mølby">Jan Mølby</a>, left wing <a href="Mark_Walters" title="Mark Walters">Mark Walters</a>, and strikers <a href="Ian_Rush" title="Ian Rush">Ian Rush</a> and <a href="Robbie_Fowler" title="Robbie Fowler">Robbie Fowler</a>. On the first two days of September 1994, Evans signed promising <a href="Republic_of_Ireland" title="Republic of Ireland">Republic of Ireland</a> defender <a href="Phil_Babb" title="Phil Babb">Phil Babb</a> from <a href="Coventry_City" title="Coventry City" class="mw-redirect">Coventry City</a> for £3.75m and Wimbledon's John Scales for £3.5m, and the duo were introduced to the side in a new-look <a href="3-5-2" title="3-5-2" class="mw-redirect">3-5-2</a> formation at <a href="St_James'_Park" title="St James' Park">St James' Park</a> against <a href="Newcastle_United" title="Newcastle United" class="mw-redirect">Newcastle</a>.</p>
<p>In his first full season (<a href="1994%E2%80%9395_in_English_football" title="1994–95 in English football">1994–95</a>) Liverpool finished fourth in the <a href="../F.A._Premier_League" title="F.A. Premier League" class="mw-redirect">Premiership</a> and won the League Cup, beating <a href="Bolton_Wanderers_F.C." title="Bolton Wanderers F.C.">Bolton Wanderers</a> 2–1 in the final.</p>
<p>In the summer of 1995, Liverpool paid <a href="Nottingham_Forest_F.C." title="Nottingham Forest F.C.">Nottingham Forest</a> a <a href="Progression_of_British_football_transfer_fee_record" title="Progression of British football transfer fee record">British record fee</a> of £8.5 million for striker <a href="Stan_Collymore" title="Stan Collymore">Stan Collymore</a>. Fowler and Collymore formed an impressive partnership for the 1995–96 season which saw veteran striker Ian Rush relegated to the substitute bench for much of the season before his departure on a free transfer to <a href="Leeds_United_F.C." title="Leeds United F.C." class="mw-redirect">Leeds United</a>. Liverpool continued to progress that season. But they finished third in the Premiership, eleven points behind champions <a href="Manchester_United" title="Manchester United" class="mw-redirect">Manchester United</a>, seven behind runners-up <a href="Newcastle_United" title="Newcastle United" class="mw-redirect">Newcastle</a>, and lost 1–0 to Manchester United in the FA Cup final. Still, Liverpool were recognised as a top team once again, and were starting to attract top players once more, to aid a talented group of young stars like <a href="Steve_McManaman" title="Steve McManaman">Steve McManaman</a>, <a href="Robbie_Fowler" title="Robbie Fowler">Robbie Fowler</a> and <a href="Jamie_Redknapp" title="Jamie Redknapp">Jamie Redknapp</a>, who were peaking. The most notable signing of the 1996 close season was <a href="Czech_Republic" title="Czech Republic">Czech</a> midfielder <a href="Patrik_Berger" title="Patrik Berger">Patrik Berger</a>, a £3.25million acquisition from <a href="Borussia_Dortmund" title="Borussia Dortmund">Borussia Dortmund</a>.</p>
<p>Liverpool led the Premiership at several stages during the <a href="1996%E2%80%9397_in_English_football" title="1996–97 in English football">1996–97</a> season, but in the end finished fourth and had to settle for a UEFA Cup place. They had been hoping to win the <a href="European_Cup_Winners'_Cup" title="European Cup Winners' Cup" class="mw-redirect">European Cup Winners' Cup</a> for the first time since 1984, but lost to <a href="Paris_St_Germain" title="Paris St Germain" class="mw-redirect">Paris St Germain</a> in the semi finals. The squad's off the field <a href="Lad_culture" title="Lad culture">lad culture</a> excesses and underachievement tag on it had also resulted in the team getting derogatorily labelled as the '<a href="Spice_Boys_(footballers)" title="Spice Boys (footballers)">Spice Boys</a>'.</p>
<p><a href="1997%E2%80%9398_in_English_football" title="1997–98 in English football">1997–98</a> saw Liverpool finish third in the Premiership for the second time in four years where they finished fourth on both other occasions. Though the critics had accused them as being 'nearly men' again, the highlight of the club's season was the emergence of young striker <a href="Michael_Owen" title="Michael Owen">Michael Owen</a>. Owen became the Premiership's equal <a href="Premier_League_Golden_Boot" title="Premier League Golden Boot">top scorer</a> in 1998 with 18 goals and became the <a href="England_national_football_team_records" title="England national football team records">youngest full England international</a> at the time.

<p><a href="G%C3%A9rard_Houllier" title="Gérard Houllier">Gérard Houllier</a>, the former <a href="France_national_football_team" title="France national football team">French</a> national coach, was drafted into the Liverpool management team for the 1998–99 season to work alongside <a href="Roy_Evans" title="Roy Evans">Roy Evans</a>. After a promising start, results took a turn for the worse and Evans found that the partnership did not suit him. He quit that November after a lacklustre 3-1 Worthington's Cup defeat to Tottenham, with Liverpool in the bottom half of the league. Houllier's reign as sole manager began with a 3-1 defeat to Leeds United, with his first win attained against Aston Villa by dint of a 4-2 win, aided by a Robbie Fowler hat-trick. Shortly afterwards, he handed a debut to 18-year old midfielder <a href="Steven_Gerrard" title="Steven Gerrard">Steven Gerrard</a>. A major followed when Steve McManaman announced he was leaving the club on a Bosman free transfer to join Real Madrid. Liverpool's form remained inconsistent and at the end of the season Liverpool finished a disappointing seventh – not even enough for a <a href="UEFA_Cup" title="UEFA Cup" class="mw-redirect">UEFA Cup</a> place.</p>
<p>Houllier performed major squad surgery during the summer of 1999, with a number of players leaving the club. The most notable departures included goalkeeper David James, who joined Aston Villa, and captain Paul Ince, who was unimpressed by Houllier's regime and was sold to Middlesbrough for £1 million. Houllier earmarked the Liverpool defence as an area for improvement, which led to the signings of centre-backs <a href="Sami_Hyypi%C3%A4" title="Sami Hyypiä">Sami Hyypiä</a> and <a href="Stephane_Henchoz" title="Stephane Henchoz" class="mw-redirect">Stephane Henchoz</a> and Newcastle's defensive midfielder <a href="Dietmar_Hamann" title="Dietmar Hamann">Dietmar Hamann</a>, while Dutch goalkeeper <a href="Sander_Westerveld" title="Sander Westerveld">Sander Westerveld</a> was signed to replace James. He also signed Czech midfielder <a href="Vladimir_Smicer" title="Vladimir Smicer" class="mw-redirect">Vladimir Smicer</a> and Guinea forward <a href="Titi_Camara" title="Titi Camara">Titi Camara</a>. Long-serving midfielder Jamie Redknapp became club captain. After a stuttering start, including a shock home defeat to newly promoted <a href="Watford_F.C." title="Watford F.C.">Watford F.C.</a>, Liverpool went on a strong mid-season run which saw the team lose just two matches in 26 and climb to third in the table by spring. With Fowler and Owen affected by injuries, Liverpool signed Leicester forward <a href="Emile_Heskey" title="Emile Heskey">Emile Heskey</a> in March for a new club record fee of £11 million. At this point, Liverpool were in a strong position to qualify for the lucrative UEFA Champions League for the first time, but ended the season poorly, failing to score and picking up just two points from their last five matches and the side ended fourth, instead having to settle for a UEFA Cup place. Some consolation lay in the team's defensive record, with only 30 goals conceded all campaign, the lowest in the top flight.</p>
<p>During the summer of 2000, Liverpool signed Bayern Munich defender <a href="Markus_Babbel" title="Markus Babbel">Markus Babbel</a> on a free transfer. Houllier then infuriated Everton supporters by signing their England international midfielder <a href="Nick_Barmby" title="Nick Barmby">Nick Barmby</a> for £6 million, who became the first player to move directly from Everton to Liverpool since 1959. German wing-back <a href="Christian_Ziege" title="Christian Ziege">Christian Ziege</a> joined in an equally controversial £5.5 million transfer from Middlesbrough.</p>
<p>Off of the pitch, September 2000 saw Liverpool become one of the founder members of the <a href="G-14" title="G-14">G-14</a> group of clubs, an organisation formed to provide a united voice for major European football clubs in negotiations with FIFA and UEFA. Liverpool would remain a member of the G-14 until its disbandment in 2008 when it was replaced by the <a href="European_Club_Association" title="European Club Association">European Club Association</a> which Liverpool subsequently joined.</p>
<p>2000–01 was Liverpool's best season for many years. The likes of <a href="Michael_Owen" title="Michael Owen">Owen</a>, <a href="Robbie_Fowler" title="Robbie Fowler">Fowler</a>, <a href="Steven_Gerrard" title="Steven Gerrard">Gerrard</a> and <a href="Sami_Hyypi%C3%A4" title="Sami Hyypiä">Hyypiä</a> contributed to the club's third place in the Premiership (thus qualifying for the Champions League) as well winning the FA Cup, League Cup and UEFA Cup, followed by the <a href="FA_Community_Shield" title="FA Community Shield">Charity Shield</a> and <a href="European_Super_Cup" title="European Super Cup" class="mw-redirect">European Super Cup</a> later in 2001. The League Cup was won by beating <a href="Birmingham_City_F.C." title="Birmingham City F.C.">Birmingham City</a> on penalties after a 1–1 draw, the FA Cup by beating <a href="Arsenal_F.C." title="Arsenal F.C.">Arsenal</a> 2–1 with two goals from <a href="Michael_Owen" title="Michael Owen">Michael Owen</a> in the last ten minutes and the UEFA Cup by beating <a href="Deportivo_Alav%C3%A9s" title="Deportivo Alavés">Alavés</a>, in an extraordinary game, 5–4 in extra time.</p>
<p>Liverpool began the 2001-02 season by beating Manchester United 2-1 to win the Charity Shield, and winning a fifth trophy of the calendar year with a 3–2 victory against Champions League winners Bayern Munich in the European Super Cup. They also confirmed their qualification to the Champions League group stages by defeating Finnish side F.C. Haka 9–1 on aggregate at the third qualifying stage. The summer transfer activity was quiet, with Norwegian full-back <a href="John_Arne_Riise" title="John Arne Riise">John Arne Riise</a> joining to replace the Tottenham-bound Ziege. However, after a costly mistake which led to a shock defeat to Bolton Wanderers, Houllier axed Westerveld and sanctioned the signings of two new goalkeepers, Feyenoord's <a href="Jerzy_Dudek" title="Jerzy Dudek">Jerzy Dudek</a> and Coventry's <a href="Chris_Kirkland" title="Chris Kirkland">Chris Kirkland</a>.</p>
<p>Liverpool finished Premiership runners-up in <a href="2001-02_FA_Premier_League" title="2001-02 FA Premier League" class="mw-redirect">2001–02</a>, their best league finish since 1991, but suffered a humiliating defeat in the <a href="Football_League_Cup" title="Football League Cup">League Cup</a> Third Round at the hands of <a href="Grimsby_Town_F.C." title="Grimsby Town F.C.">Grimsby Town</a>. 2001 was also dramatic for Houllier personally as he suffered a major heart problem in the October league match against Leeds, which required major surgery and prevented him from returning to the dugout until March 2002. In his absence, Houllier's replacement Phil Thompson maintained the club's title challenge, although many Liverpool fans were upset by the decision to sell Robbie Fowler to Leeds in November 2001. Liverpool's first Champions League campaign was ended at the quarter-final stage by German side (and eventual runners-up) Bayer Leverkusen, who defeated the Reds 4–3 on aggregate.</p>
<p>Liverpool won another League Cup in <a href="2002%E2%80%9303_Football_League_Cup" title="2002–03 Football League Cup">2003</a>, with a 2–0 victory over Manchester United, but the league campaign was a disappointment. After a good start, which saw the Reds top the table in November 2002, the team did not win a league match for another two months - their longest streak of not winning any games in the top flight - during which time the team fell as low as seventh in the table. Eventually, the team finished fifth after a final day defeat at Chelsea, leading to the club missing out on Champions League football for the following campaign. Houllier's transfer activity in the summer of 2002 was criticised, with <a href="El-Hadji_Diouf" title="El-Hadji Diouf" class="mw-redirect">El-Hadji Diouf</a>, <a href="Salif_Diao" title="Salif Diao">Salif Diao</a> and <a href="Bruno_Cheyrou" title="Bruno Cheyrou">Bruno Cheyrou</a> all disappointing. Despite the signings of <a href="Harry_Kewell" title="Harry Kewell">Harry Kewell</a> and <a href="Steve_Finnan" title="Steve Finnan">Steve Finnan</a>, in <a href="2003%E2%80%9304_in_English_football" title="2003–04 in English football">2003–04</a> Houllier came no closer to winning the league title, in fact finishing thirty points behind the champions Arsenal. Although Liverpool qualified for the <a href="UEFA_Champions_League" title="UEFA Champions League">Champions League</a> by finishing fourth (making three qualifications during his tenure), fans saw Houllier's conservative and defensive tactics as sacrificing too much attacking impetus to challenge Arsenal and Manchester United for the title, and pointed to disappointing results such as a 2–1 reverse at home to Southampton in December 2003. Against a background of growing disquiet amongst the Liverpool supporters, Houllier was dismissed on 24 May 2004 and subsequently replaced by the <a href="Spain" title="Spain">Spaniard</a> <a href="Rafael_Ben%C3%ADtez" title="Rafael Benítez">Rafael Benítez</a> who had just guided <a href="Valencia_C.F." title="Valencia C.F." class="mw-redirect">Valencia</a> to the <a href="La_Liga" title="La Liga">Spanish league</a> title and UEFA Cup.</p>

In the 2004–05 season, four English teams had qualified under then existing UEFA guidelines for the Champions League competition: Chelsea, Arsenal, Manchester United, and Everton, who had finished in places first to fourth place respectively in the Premier League. Liverpool argued that as winners of the Champions League, they should be allowed to defend their title – <a href="The_FA" title="The FA" class="mw-redirect">the FA</a> stipulated that their selections for the Champions League, as in any year, would go to the 4 highest placed clubs in the Premier League, excluding 5th placed Liverpool. The situation was eventually resolved by special dispensation of UEFA, which added Liverpool to the first qualifying round of the <a href="2005%E2%80%9306_UEFA_Champions_League" title="2005–06 UEFA Champions League">2005–06</a> event. UEFA created an automatic berth in the qualifying round for every subsequent Champions League winner who had not qualified outright through the league.</p>

<p>After a solid run through qualifying and the group stage, Liverpool's defence of the Champions League title ended in the last sixteen in March 2006, being knocked out 3–0 on aggregate by the unfancied <a href="Football_in_Portugal" title="Football in Portugal">Portuguese</a> side, <a href="../S.L._Benfica" title="S.L.

<p>The season of 2007–2008 saw the first season Liverpool had failed to reach a major final under the reign of Benítez. Despite not making a cup final and having a low tally in the Premiership table, this squad is considered Liverpool's strongest under Benítez.

<p><a href="2009%E2%80%9310_in_English_football" title="2009–10 in English football">2009–10</a> was a frustrating season for the Reds, who under-performed for much of the season and finished seventh in the Premier League (their lowest finish since 1999), though fortunately they were able to secure an eleventh successive European campaign through the <a href="UEFA_Europa_League" title="UEFA Europa League">UEFA Europa League</a> due to the fact that runners-up Manchester United were League Cup winners and champions Chelsea were in the FA Cup final (with their opponents <a href="Portsmouth_F.C." title="Portsmouth F.C.">Portsmouth</a> unable to play in Europe due to financial problems).<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8660536.stm">[31]</a> Rafael Benítez's job as manager had reportedly been under serious threat, with former manager <a href="Kenny_Dalglish" title="Kenny Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> (back at the club since being appointed in a youth academy capacity in 2009) being touted as a possible successor <a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/blog/2010/jan/15/rafael-benitez-kenny-dalglish-liverpool">[32]</a>, along with <a href="Fulham_F.C." title="Fulham F.C.">Fulham</a> manager <a href="Roy_Hodgson" title="Roy Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a>.<a rel="nofollow" class="external autonumber" href="http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/sport/801472/RED-ROY-AS-LIVERPOOL-TARGET-FULHAM-BOSS-Hodgson-tells-friends-hes-interested-in-Anfield-post.html">[33]</a> Benítez left Liverpool by mutual consent on 3 June 2010.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=History_of_Liverpool_F.C.&action=edit&section=15.php.html" title="Edit section: Roy Hodgson arrives (2010–2011)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Roy_Hodgson_arrives_.282010.E2.80.932011.29">Roy Hodgson arrives (2010–2011)</span></h2>
<p>On 1 July 2010, <a href="Roy_Hodgson" title="Roy Hodgson">Roy Hodgson</a> was officially appointed as manager of <a href="Liverpool_F.C." title="Liverpool F.C.">Liverpool</a>, signing a three–year contract with the Anfield club.<sup id="cite_ref-Roy_Hodgson_leaves_Fulham_to_become_Liverpool_manager_21-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Roy_Hodgson_leaves_Fulham_to_become_Liverpool_manager-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup> He was appointed in time to welcome players not involved in <a href="2010_FIFA_World_Cup" title="2010 FIFA World Cup">World Cup</a> action back to pre-season training at <a href="Melwood" title="Melwood">Melwood</a>, and was officially unveiled to the media at press conference at Anfield on 1 July 2010. Hodgson, on his appointment said "This is the biggest job in club football and I’m honoured to be taking on the role of manager of Britain's most successful football club. I look forward to meeting the players and the supporters and getting down to work at Melwood."<sup id="cite_ref-22" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-22"><span>[</span>22<span>]</span></a></sup> In July 2010, Liverpool signed former Chelsea midfielder Joe Cole on a free transfer. He was subsequently joined by fellow midfielders Christian Poulsen, from Juventus, and Raul Meireles from F.C. Porto, as well as full-back Paul Konchesky from Hodgson's previous club Fulham. Hodgson's tenure got off to a reasonable start, with qualification to the play- offs of the Europa League secured via a 4-0 aggregate thrashing of minnows FC Rabotnicki. An encouraging performance and 1-1 draw against Arsenal on the opening day of the 2010-11 Premier League season gave Liverpool fans reason to be optimistic for the coming season, although a red card to Joe Cole meant he would miss the next three league games. A 3-0 demolition by Manchester City at Eastlands set the tone for the Reds away form for the season, and an unconvincing 1-0 victory against West Brom ended the month. Liverpool scraped through to the Europa League group stage with a 3-1 aggregate win. September was a poor month in the Premier League, yielding frustrating draws against Birmingham and Sunderland, and a poor display in a 3-2 defeat at Old Traford left Liverpool languishing mid- table in the Premier League. Even worse was one of Liverpool F.C.'s most humiliating defeats of all time, a penalty defeat against League 2 Northampton Town in the League Cup. The month was softened slightly, with a win and a draw in the Europa League group stage.</p>
<p>Another hugely embarrassing defeat for Liverpool came in the form of Blackpool, who ran out shock 2-1 winners at Anfield. A hugely disappointing performance against Everton in the Merseyside Derby, which Liverpool deservedly lost 2-0, left them in the Premier League's relegation zone. This sparked the first sign of fans turning on Hodgson after he appeared to laugh after the defeat as he shook hands with David Moyes, not only that but his assessment that this had been one of his sides 'best performances' left Liverpool fans furious. Liverpool began to show signs of a recovery, with a convincing performance and 2-1 win against Blackburn at Anfield, and a late winner against Bolton to give Hodgson his first away win. Liverpool had escaped the relegation zone, but not the battle. A reasonable 0-0 away draw against Napoli provided further encouraging signs in Europe, as did a 3-1 victory against the same side courtesy of a hat-trick by half time substitute Steven Gerrard.</p>
<p>Liverpool's best performance under Hodgson came in a 2-0 win against Chelsea at Anfield, both goals coming from Fernando Torres. Liverpool's recovery was somewhat halted after a surprise 1-1 draw against Wigan. More disappointment on the road was to follow after a dismal performance and result against Stoke City, which resulted in a 2-0 loss for the Reds. However, Liverpool were fine at Anfield with a 3-0 win against West Ham. Despite leading Tottenham Hotspur at half time Liverpool collapsed at White Hart Lane and lost in the last minute- 2-1. Liverpool thrashed Aston Villa at Anfield in their first December game, a 3-0 win against their former manager Gerard Houllier, but this was followed up by another dreadful away performance against Newcastle resulted in a 3-1 defeat at St James Park. This was also the scene for 'Hodgson's face rub' where the manager placed his hands on his head and rubbed them in an unusually vicious manner. Unfortunately for Hodgson, this would be one of the symbolic images of his tenure. Roy Hodgson's position became untenable after a shock 1-0 defeat to relegation-threatened Wolves at Anfield left Liverpool fans visibly distraught, with many chanting ironic chants like 'Hodgson for England!' (in reference to Roy being linked with the job in the summer) and even joining in with the away support in singing 'You're getting sacked in the morning!' The fans had turned on Hodgson, and booed when David N'gog was hauled off for Ryan Babel, and cheered ironically when Paul Konchesky was substituted. The boos at the final whistle summed the situation up.</p>
<p>In their next game at Anfield, Liverpool ran out 2-1 winners on New Years Day against Bolton, thanks to a late Joe Cole winner, but Hodgson would last just one more week in the post. In what was arguably Liverpool's worst performance of the season, and some say their worst ever in the Premier League, they were humiliated 3-1 by Blackburn Rovers at Ewood Park. The Reds had been 3-0 down but Steven Gerrard managed to grab a consolation with ten minutes to go, and a late penalty could have made the score 3-2 but the captain fired his shot over the bar.</p>

<p>With Liverpool in poor form and placing 12th in the Premier League on 8 January 2011, Roy Hodgson left Liverpool by mutual consent paving the way for <a href="Kenny_Dalglish" title="Kenny Dalglish">Kenny Dalglish</a> to return and step in as manager until the end of the season. His second spell in charge began with a 1-0 defeat to <a href="Manchester_United" title="Manchester United" class="mw-redirect">Manchester United</a> in the F.A. Cup, although the team's performance was an improvement on the showings against Blackburn and Wolves. The side was defeated by Blackpool, before drawing 2-2 in the Merseyside Derby. Dalglish's first win came in the form of a 3-0 win against the latter side on 22 January, in which Torres scored twice. These strikes turned out to his final goals for the club, as on 31 January 2011 the unhappy Spain striker left to join <a href="Chelsea_F.C." title="Chelsea F.C.">Chelsea F.C.</a> for a fee believed to be £50 million. A deal had already been agreed to sign Ajax and Uruguay forward <a href="Luis_Su%C3%A1rez" title="Luis Suárez">Luis Suárez</a> for a fee of £22.7 million, but on transfer deadline day he was joined by Newcastle striker <a href="Andy_Carroll" title="Andy Carroll">Andy Carroll</a> who signed as a replacement for Torres at a cost of £35 million - a record fee for a British footballer. Suárez marked his debut with a goal in a 2-0 win against Stoke City after coming on as a substitute, before Liverpool defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in Torres's first game for his new side, with Raul Meireles scoring the winner.</p>
<p>After slightly disappointing results against Wigan Athletic and West Ham United, Liverpool returned to top form with a 3-1 victory over Manchester United at Anfield, where Dirk Kuyt scored his first hat-trick for the club and Carroll made his debut. The side were then knocked out of the Europa League 1-0 on aggregate by Portuguese side Sporting Braga. The revival in the league continued with a 2-0 away win against Sunderland, but was then halted by <a href="West_Bromwich_Albion_F.C." title="West Bromwich Albion F.C.">West Brom</a>, now managed by Roy Hodgson, who beat the Reds 2-1 at the Hawthorns.</p>
<p>Despite this, Liverpool then produced a fine performance to comfortably defeat a lacklustre Manchester City 3-0, with Carroll scoring his first goals for the club, before attaining a creditable draw away to Arsenal. Soon after followed three more comprehensive victories, with Birmingham City and Fulham beaten by scores of 5-0 and 5-2 respectively - <a href="Maxi_Rodriguez" title="Maxi Rodriguez" class="mw-redirect">Maxi Rodriguez</a> scoring trebles in both matches - in games sandwiched by a 3-0 win over Newcastle. This form placed Liverpool fifth in the league, ahead of Tottenham Hotspur, but this run was ended by the London team, who won 2-0 at Anfield, before the season ended in defeat to Aston Villa. The club later finished 6th in the league, four points behind Tottenham Hotspur, which denied Liverpool European football for the first time in 12 years.</p>
<p>There was considerable transfer activity at the club during the summer of 2011. The club initially focused on signing midfielders, with the young Sunderland midfielder <a href="Jordan_Henderson" title="Jordan Henderson">Jordan Henderson</a> signing for a fee of approximately £16 million soon being joined by <a href="Stewart_Downing" title="Stewart Downing">Stewart Downing</a> from Aston Villa and <a href="Charlie_Adam" title="Charlie Adam">Charlie Adam</a> from Blackpool. The club also signed Uruguayan centre-back <a href="Sebastian_Coates" title="Sebastian Coates" class="mw-redirect">Sebastian Coates</a> for £6 million, and ex-Roma goalkeeper <a href="Alexander_Doni" title="Alexander Doni" class="mw-redirect">Alexander Doni</a>. Numerous first-team players were sold, including the unsuccessful Hodgson signings Poulsen and Konchesky, as well as David N'Gog, Sotirios Kyrgiakos and Milan Jovanovic, while Joe Cole and Alberto Aquilani were loaned out to Lille and A.C. Milan respectively. Raul Meireles also left the club on transfer deadline day to join Chelsea, which also saw Craig Bellamy rejoin the club from Manchester City.</p>
<p>The season began with a 1-1 draw against Sunderland, which was followed by a 2-0 win away to Arsenal and a 3-1 home win over Bolton. This promising start to the season was ended by a defeats to Stoke and Tottenham, in the latter case a 4-0 embarrassment in which Adam and Skrtel were sent off. In October, Liverpool beat rivals Everton 2-0 at Goodison Park and drew 1-1 with Manchester United, although the latter match was more notable due to the controversy between Luis Suárez and Patrice Evra in which the Uruguayan was found to have made a racially abusive comment to the Manchester United defender, which led to an eight-match ban. In November, Liverpool twice defeated Chelsea at Stamford Bridge, in the first incidence by a 2-1 margin in the league, the second a 2-0 in the quarter-finals of the League Cup. Unfortunately, during the latter game Lucas Leiva picked up an anterior cruciate ligament injury, which was to put him out for the rest of the campaign. In between these games, the side drew 1-1 with league leaders Manchester City. The team's form through December was mixed, with a 2-0 win at Aston Villa offsetting a 1-0 reverse at Fulham, where Suárez caused further controversy with a gesture towards the home fans, leading to a further ban.</p>
<p>Liverpool rounded off 2011 with a strong 3-1 home victory over Newcastle United, leaving the club in 6th place in the Premier League table at the half-way point of the <a href="2011%E2%80%9312_in_English_football" title="2011–12 in English football">2011-12</a> season, with the goal of Champions League qualification still within reach. On the 25th of January, 2012, Liverpool knocked <a href="Manchester_City" title="Manchester City" class="mw-redirect">Manchester City</a> out of the League Cup semi-finals 3-2 on aggregate to progress to their first final since <a href="2007_Champions_League_Final" title="2007 Champions League Final" class="mw-redirect">2007</a>. Their opposition was Championship side <a href="Cardiff_City" title="Cardiff City" class="mw-redirect">Cardiff City</a>. Liverpool would later go on to draw 1-1 in normal time, then 2-2 in extra time, then win the cup on penalties, after Cardiff fought valiantly to force extra time. The League Cup triumph meant Liverpool had ended their drought of 6 consecutive seasons without a trophy. This cup win came amidst the worst run of form the club had experienced in 58 years, which by April had the team sitting 8th in the league. The sole highlight in this league run was a 3-0 home win against Everton, where Steven Gerrard scored a hat-trick. The poor run of form was ended by a 3-2 win over Blackburn Rovers with a late winner from Andy Carroll. Four days later Liverpool reached the FA Cup final by defeating Merseyside rivals Everton 2-1 with goals from Luis Suárez and another late winner from Andy Carroll,But they only went on to lose the final 2-1 by goals from <a href="Ramires" title="Ramires">Ramires</a> and <a href="Didier_Drogba" title="Didier Drogba">Didier Drogba</a> with Andy Carroll getting a goal back. They went on to finish 8th with 52 points there lowest league finish since the 1993–94 season and lowest points tally ever in the Premier League.

Subsequent official club statements later confirmed that Tom Hicks and George Gillet were reluctant to commit to future transfer activity until later in the year, when the status of Liverpool's involvement in the UEFA Champions League had been resolved, and had therefore told Benítez to concentrate on coaching and training his existing pool of players.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>
<p>On 22 January 2008 Liverpool fans, at the game between Liverpool and <a href="Aston_Villa" title="Aston Villa" class="mw-redirect">Aston Villa</a>, protested against Gillett and Hicks' running of the club, and urged the pair to sell their shares in Liverpool F.C. to DIC. Neither owner, nor their representative Foster Gillett were present at the game. Subsequently, opposition to Hicks's ownership has started to become more structured, with groups emerging to campaign against them. Initially, Hicks stated that the entire incident was "a big misunderstanding blown out of all proportion" and that his relationship with Benítez could not be any better.</p>
<p>When he first purchased half of Liverpool F.C. Hicks stated that "Parry and Moores will have a continuing role, stability is a key to success." However, it was soon revealed that Hicks had requested for <a href="Rick_Parry" title="Rick Parry">Rick Parry</a> to hand in his resignation.

<p>On 4 June 2007, <a href="UEFA" title="UEFA">UEFA</a> spokesman <a href="William_Gaillard" title="William Gaillard">William Gaillard</a> was quoted in media reports citing a UEFA report claiming that Liverpool fans were 'the worst fans in Europe'.<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>32<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The most publicised claims from the report were that 'fans stole tickets from children' and that 'fans without tickets charged entry gates'. Furthermore, Gaillard claimed that up to '25 incidents involving Liverpool fans' had occurred since 2003, and were outlined in the report compiled by an unnamed police force in Europe.<sup id="cite_ref-news.bbc.co.uk_33-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-news.bbc.co.uk-33"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>However, Phil Hammond, who lost his son Philip at Hillsborough in 1989 and is chairman of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, was also critical of the behaviour of the Liverpool fans, saying:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"My heart sank as I stood and watched what was happening. After what happened in Sheffield in 1989 I couldn’t believe Liverpool fans, of all people, could do such dangerous things. I honestly feared people were going to get crushed and we were going to have another Hillsborough. It was disgusting. The people who stormed into the stadium are the scum of the earth. They put at risk hundreds of lives and should be ashamed of themselves. The vast majority of Liverpool fans are impeccably behaved, but there has always been a hard core of mindless thugs that ruin it for the rest. It hurts me to say this, but I won’t be following Liverpool on their travels in future."</p>
