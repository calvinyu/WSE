<p>Sedaka was born in <a href="Brooklyn,_New_York" title="Brooklyn, New York" class="mw-redirect">Brooklyn, New York</a>. His father, Mac Sedaka, was a <a href="Taxi" title="Taxi" class="mw-redirect">taxi</a> driver and a Sephardic Jew of Turkish descent . ("Sedaka" and "Sedacca" are variants of <a href="Tzedaka" title="Tzedaka" class="mw-redirect">tzedaka</a>, which translates in both <a href="Hebrew" title="Hebrew" class="mw-redirect">Hebrew</a> and <a href="Arabic" title="Arabic" class="mw-redirect">Arabic</a> as the word <i>charity</i>). Sedaka's mother, Eleanor (née Appel), is an Ashkenazi Jew of Polish-Russian descent. He grew up in the then-heavily Jewish Brooklyn neighborhood of <a href="Brighton_Beach,_Brooklyn" title="Brighton Beach, Brooklyn" class="mw-redirect">Brighton Beach</a>, which lies on the shore of the Atlantic Ocean.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Sedaka is a cousin of singer <a href="Eydie_Gorm%C3%A9" title="Eydie Gormé">Eydie Gormé</a>.</p>
<p>He demonstrated musical aptitude in his second-grade choral class, and when his teacher sent a note home suggesting he take piano lessons, his mother took a part-time job in an <a href="Abraham_&_Straus" title="Abraham &amp; Straus">Abraham &amp; Straus</a> department store for six months to pay for a second-hand upright. In 1947, he auditioned successfully for a piano scholarship to the <a href="Juilliard_School_of_Music" title="Juilliard School of Music" class="mw-redirect">Juilliard School of Music</a>'s Preparatory Division for Children, which he attended on Saturdays. His mother wanted him to become a renowned classical pianist such as the contemporary of the day, <a href="Van_Cliburn" title="Van Cliburn">Van Cliburn</a>, but Sedaka was discovering pop music. When Sedaka was 13, a neighbor heard him playing and introduced him to her 16-year-old son, <a href="Howard_Greenfield" title="Howard Greenfield">Howard Greenfield</a>, an aspiring poet and lyricist. They became two of the legendary <a href="Brill_Building" title="Brill Building">Brill Building</a>'s composers.</p>
<p>Sedaka and Greenfield wrote songs together throughout much of their young lives, with Sedaka going on to being a major teen pop star and the pair also writing hits for a litany of other artists as well as for Sedaka's own career. However, when <a href="The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a> and the <a href="British_Invasion" title="British Invasion">British Invasion</a> took American music in a different direction, Sedaka was left without a recording career and decided a major change in his life was necessary, moving his family to Britain in the early 1970s. Sedaka and Greenfield mutually agreed that their partnership was at an end with "Our Last Song Together". Sedaka began a new composing partnership with lyricist Phil Cody, who was born and raised in Pleasantville, NY. After Sedaka returned to the US, however, the Sedaka-Greenfield team eventually reunited and continued until Greenfield's death in 1986.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from November 2011">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>

<p>After graduating from <a href="Abraham_Lincoln_High_School_(Brooklyn)" title="Abraham Lincoln High School (Brooklyn)">Abraham Lincoln High School</a>, Sedaka and some of his classmates formed a band called <a href="The_Tokens" title="The Tokens">The Tokens</a>. The band had minor regional hits with songs like "While I Dream", "I Love My Baby", "Come Back, Joe", and "Don't Go", before Sedaka launched out on his own in 1957. Eventually, after a few personnel changes, in 1961, the Tokens hit No. 1 on the <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> pop charts with the international smash "<a href="The_Lion_Sleeps_Tonight" title="The Lion Sleeps Tonight">The Lion Sleeps Tonight</a>". Meanwhile, the very young Sedaka's first three solo singles, "Laura Lee", "Ring-a-Rockin'", and "Oh, Delilah!" failed to become hits (although "Ring-a-Rockin'" earned him the first of many appearances on <a href="Dick_Clark" title="Dick Clark">Dick Clark</a>'s <i><a href="American_Bandstand" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a></i>), but they demonstrated his ability to perform as a solo singer, so <a href="RCA_Victor" title="RCA Victor" class="mw-redirect">RCA Victor</a> signed him to a recording contract.</p>
<p>His first single for RCA, "<a href="The_Diary_(song)" title="The Diary (song)">The Diary</a>", was inspired by <a href="Connie_Francis" title="Connie Francis">Connie Francis</a>, one of Sedaka and Greenfield's most important clients, while the three were taking a temporary break during their idea-making for a new song. Francis was writing in her diary, Sedaka asked if he could read it, and Connie promptly replied no. After <a href="Little_Anthony_and_the_Imperials" title="Little Anthony and the Imperials">Little Anthony and the Imperials</a> passed on the song, Sedaka recorded it himself, and his debut single hit the Top 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, peaking at No. 14 in 1958. His followup, a novelty tune titled "<a href="I_Go_Ape" title="I Go Ape">I Go Ape</a>", just missed the Top 40, peaking at No. 42. The third single, "<a href="Crying_My_Heart_Out_for_You" title="Crying My Heart Out for You">Crying My Heart Out for You</a>", did even worse, missing the Hot 100 entirely, peaking at No. 111 (although it went to No. 6 on the pop charts in Italy). Desperate for another hit, he bought several hit singles and listened to them repeatedly, studying the song structure, chord progressions, lyrics and harmonies—and he discovered that the hit songs of the day all shared the same basic musical anatomy. Armed with his newfound arsenal of musical knowledge, he set out to craft his next big hit song, and he promptly did exactly that: "<a href="Oh!_Carol" title="Oh! Carol">Oh! Carol</a>" delivered Sedaka his first domestic Top 10 hit, reaching No. 9 on the Hot 100 in 1959 and going to No. 1 on the Italian pop charts in 1960, giving Sedaka his first No. 1 ranking. The song was dedicated to his girlfriend at the time, Carole Klein, later to become <a href="Carole_King" title="Carole King">Carole King</a>, a fellow Brill Building composer and future pop star; for the title, however, Sedaka and Greenfield used the more traditional spelling of the word "Carol" without the "e"; King would respond with her own novelty song, "Oh! Neil", later that year.</p>

<p>After establishing himself in 1958, Sedaka kept churning out new hits from 1960 to 1962. His flow of Top 30 hits during this period included: "<a href="Stairway_to_Heaven_(Neil_Sedaka_song)" title="Stairway to Heaven (Neil Sedaka song)">Stairway to Heaven</a>" (No. 9, 1960); "<a href="You_Mean_Everything_to_Me_(song)" title="You Mean Everything to Me (song)">You Mean Everything to Me</a>" (No. 17, 1960); "<a href="Run,_Samson,_Run" title="Run, Samson, Run" class="mw-redirect">Run, Samson, Run</a>" (No. 27, 1960); "<a href="Calendar_Girl_(song)" title="Calendar Girl (song)">Calendar Girl</a>" (No. 4, 1961; also reached No. 1 on the Japanese pop charts); "<a href="Little_Devil" title="Little Devil">Little Devil</a>" (No. 11, 1961); "<a href="Happy_Birthday_Sweet_Sixteen" title="Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen">Happy Birthday Sweet Sixteen</a>" (No. 6, 1961); his signature song, "<a href="Breaking_Up_Is_Hard_To_Do" title="Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" class="mw-redirect">Breaking Up Is Hard To Do</a>" (No. 1, two weeks: August 11 and 18, 1962); and "<a href="Next_Door_to_an_Angel" title="Next Door to an Angel">Next Door to an Angel</a>" (No. 5, 1962). Singles not making the Top 30 during this time period included "Sweet Little You" (No. 59, 1961) and "King of Clowns" (No. 45, 1962). RCA issued four LPs in the U.S. and Britain of his works during this period, and also produced <i><a href="Scopitone" title="Scopitone">Scopitone</a></i> and <i><a href="Cinebox" title="Cinebox">Cinebox</a></i> videos of "Calendar Girl" in 1961, "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" in 1962, and "The Dreamer" in 1963. He made regular appearances on such TV programs as <i><a href="American_Bandstand" title="American Bandstand">American Bandstand</a></i> and <i><a href="Shindig!" title="Shindig!">Shindig!</a></i> during this period.</p>

<p>When Sedaka was not recording his own songs, he and Howard Greenfield were writing for other performers, most notably in their earliest days <a href="Connie_Francis" title="Connie Francis">Connie Francis</a>. Francis began searching for a new hit after her 1958 single "<a href="../Who's_Sorry_Now/index-.html" title="Who's Sorry Now?">Who's Sorry Now?</a>". She was introduced to Sedaka and Greenfield, who played every ballad they had written for her. Francis began writing in her diary while the two played the last of their songs. After they finished, Francis told them they wrote beautiful ballads but that they were too intellectual for the young generation. Sedaka suggested to Greenfield a song they had written that morning for a girl group. Greenfield protested because the song had been promised to the girl group, but Sedaka insisted on playing "<a href="Stupid_Cupid" title="Stupid Cupid">Stupid Cupid</a>". Francis told them they had just played her new hit. Francis' song reached No. 14 on the <i>Billboard</i> charts.</p>
<p>While Francis was writing in her diary, Sedaka asked her if he could read what she had written. After she refused, Sedaka was inspired to write "The Diary", his own first hit single. Sedaka and Greenfield wrote many of Connie Francis' hits, such as "Fallin'" and the "Theme from <i><a href="Where_the_Boys_Are" title="Where the Boys Are">Where the Boys Are</a></i>", the film in which she starred. This hit the Top 5 on the <i>Billboard</i> pop singles chart and Francis had several No. 1 singles. "Where the Boys Are" eventually became her signature song.</p>

<p>Sedaka and Greenfield also wrote some of <a href="Jimmy_Clanton" title="Jimmy Clanton">Jimmy Clanton</a>'s hits, such as "Another Sleepless Night," "What Am I Gonna Do?" and "All the Words in the World." Sedaka himself recorded each of these three songs: "Another Sleepless Night" appears on his <i>Rock With Sedaka</i> debut album; "What Am I Gonna Do?" was the B-side of "Going Home to Mary Lou" and appeared on his 1961 album <i>Neil Sedaka Sings "Little Devil" and His Other Hits</i>; and "All the Words in the World" was recorded but was kept in the RCA vaults until 1977, at the height of Sedaka's return to popularity, when it was released on the album <i>Neil Sedaka: The '50s and '60s</i>.</p>

<p>Sedaka was very popular in <a href="Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>.

<i><a href="Neil_Sedaka__Italiano" title="Neil Sedaka: Italiano">Neil Sedaka: Italiano</a></i>, from 1964, the first of three Italian-language LPs released by RCA Italiana</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In 1961, Sedaka began to record some of his hits in Italian, starting with "Esagerata" and "Un Giorno Inutile", local versions of "Little Devil" and "I Must Be Dreaming". Other recordings were to follow, such as "Tu Non Lo Sai" ("Breaking Up Is Hard to Do"), "Il Re Dei Pagliacci" ("King of Clowns"), "I Tuoi Capricci" ("Look Inside Your Heart"), and "La Terza Luna" ("Waiting For Never"). "La Terza Luna" reached No. 1 on the Italian pop charts in April 1963. <i><a href="Cinebox" title="Cinebox">Cinebox</a></i> videos exist for "La Terza Luna" and "I Tuoi Capricci". From a language standpoint, his recordings in Italian had very little American accent. RCA Victor's <a href="RCA_Italiana" title="RCA Italiana" class="mw-redirect">Italiana</a> office distributed his records in Italy and released three compilation LPs of Sedaka's Italian recordings.</p>
<p>Sedaka also recorded in Spanish, German, Hebrew, and Japanese. Even in these countries, his English-language recordings were quite popular; "Calendar Girl" scored a No. 1 on the Japanese pop charts in the autumn of 1961. He enjoyed popularity in Latin America for his Spanish-language recordings. Many of these were pressed onto 78 rpm discs.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Neil_Sedaka&action=edit&section=9.php.html" title="Edit section: Mid-1960s decline">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Mid-1960s_decline">Mid-1960s decline</span></h2>
<p>The year 1962 provided Sedaka with one of his career's most important years, as Sedaka scored a No. 1 with "Breaking Up Is Hard To Do" and a No. 5 with "Next Door To An Angel". But after 1962, Sedaka's popularity began to wane. His singles for 1963 enjoyed modest success: "Alice In Wonderland" (No. 17), "Let's Go Steady Again" (No. 26), "The Dreamer" (No. 47), and "Bad Girl" (No. 33). "Bad Girl" would be Sedaka's last Top 40 hit in the US until 1974.</p>
<p>Starting in 1964, Sedaka's career went into a sharp decline, hastened by <a href="The_Beatles" title="The Beatles">The Beatles</a>' arrival on the radio and especially their much-hyped February 1964 appearance on <a href="CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>'s <i><a href="The_Ed_Sullivan_Show" title="The Ed Sullivan Show">The Ed Sullivan Show</a></i> and the rest of the British Invasion. When describing the Beatles' effect on his career in the mid-1960s, he puts it brusquely: "The Beatles—not good!"<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> From 1964 to 1966, only three of his singles cracked the Hot 100: "Sunny" (No. 86, 1964), "The World through a Tear" (No. 76, 1965), and "The Answer to My Prayer" (No. 89, 1965). His other singles from this era - "The Closest Thing To Heaven", "I Hope He Breaks Your Heart", "Let The People Talk", "The Answer Lies Within" and "We Can Make It If We Try" - were all commercial failures.</p>
<p>To make matters worse, Sedaka's employers at RCA Victor refused to release his new recording, "<a href="It_Hurts_to_Be_in_Love" title="It Hurts to Be in Love">It Hurts to Be in Love</a>", because he had not recorded it in their studios, as stipulated by his contract. Sedaka attempted another recording of this song in RCA's studios, but the results were unsatisfactory. Howard Greenfield and Helen Miller, the song's co-writers, offered it to <a href="Gene_Pitney" title="Gene Pitney">Gene Pitney</a> instead, and he took the existing musical track, replacing Sedaka's lead vocal track with Pitney's own. Everything else was Sedaka's, including his own arrangement and backing vocals, piano-playing, and usual female backup singers. Pitney ended up with a No. 7 hit for himself and his record label, <a href="Musicor_Records" title="Musicor Records">Musicor</a>, in 1964.</p>
<p>For the remainder of his tenure with RCA Victor, Sedaka never fully recovered from the effects of Beatlemania, the loss of "It Hurts to Be in Love" to Pitney, or the failure of his recordings. RCA chose not to renew his contract when it expired in 1966, leaving him without a record label.</p>
<p>Although Sedaka's stature as a recording artist was at a low ebb in the late 1960s, he was able to maintain his career through songwriting. Thanks to the fact that his publisher, Aldon Music, was acquired by <a href="Screen_Gems" title="Screen Gems">Screen Gems</a>, two of his songs were recorded by <a href="The_Monkees" title="The Monkees">The Monkees</a>, and other hits in this period written by Sedaka included <a href="The_Cyrkle" title="The Cyrkle">The Cyrkle</a>'s version of "We Had a Good Thing Goin'" and "Workin' on a Groovy Thing", a Top 40 R&amp;B hit for <a href="Patti_Drew" title="Patti Drew">Patti Drew</a> in 1968, and a Top 20 pop hit for <a href="The_5th_Dimension" title="The 5th Dimension">The 5th Dimension</a> in 1969. Also, "Make the Music Play" was included on <a href="Frankie_Valli" title="Frankie Valli">Frankie Valli</a>'s charting album <i>Timeless</i>.</p>
<p>On an episode of the quiz show <i><a href="I've_Got_a_Secret" title="I've Got a Secret">I've Got a Secret</a></i> in 1965, Sedaka's secret was that he was to represent the United States in classical piano at the 1966 <a href="Tchaikovsky" title="Tchaikovsky" class="mw-redirect">Tchaikovsky</a> competition in <a href="Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>, and he impressed the panelists with his performance of Frederic Chopin's "<a href="Fantaisie_Impromptu" title="Fantaisie Impromptu" class="mw-redirect">Fantaisie Impromptu</a>" on the show. Prior to his piano performance, panelist <a href="Henry_Morgan_(comedian)" title="Henry Morgan (comedian)">Henry Morgan</a> challenged Sedaka with the fact that the Soviet bureaucracy despised—and, in fact, outlawed—rock 'n' roll music, and that any Western music that young Russians have was by underground smuggling. This exchange continued before the panel learned that Sedaka was to represent the USA at the Tchaikovsky classical piano competition, which <a href="Van_Cliburn" title="Van Cliburn">Van Cliburn</a> had won in 1958. Morgan's warning turned out to be true: despite Sedaka's classical roots, because of his "other" life as a pop star, he was disqualified by the USSR as the US entrant for the competition.</p>
<p>Sedaka also made an appearance in the 1968 movie <i>Playgirl Killer</i>, with a scene of him performing a song called "The Waterbug".</p>

<p>Sedaka worked to revive his solo career in the early 1970s. Despite his waning chart appeal in the USA in the late 1960s, he remained very popular as a concert attraction, notably in the UK and Australia. Years later he thanked <a href="Bob_Rogers_(disc_jockey)" title="Bob Rogers (disc jockey)">Bob Rogers</a> and <a href="Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> for standing by him. "...You know, Bob, in my lean years — I called them <i><a href="The_Hungry_Years" title="The Hungry Years">The Hungry Years</a></i> — it was Bob Rogers and Australia who welcomed me."<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> He made several trips to Australia to play cabaret dates, and his commercial comeback began when the single "Star-Crossed Lovers" became a major hit there. The song went to No. 5 nationally in April 1969<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> — giving Sedaka his first charting single anywhere in four years.

<p>Later that year, with the support of <a href="Festival_Records_(Australia)" title="Festival Records (Australia)" class="mw-redirect">Festival Records</a>, he recorded a new LP of original material entitled <i>Workin' on a Groovy Thing</i> (released in the United Kingdom as <i>Sounds of Sedaka</i>) at Festival Studios in Sydney.

<p>In 1971, Sedaka released the <i><a href="Emergence_(Neil_Sedaka_album)" title="Emergence (Neil Sedaka album)">Emergence</a></i> album. Singles from that album included "I'm A Song (Sing Me)," "Silent Movies," "Superbird," and "Rosemary Blue." <i>Emergence</i> and the next year's <i><a href="Solitaire_(Neil_Sedaka_album)" title="Solitaire (Neil Sedaka album)">Solitaire</a></i> album were both released on the RCA Victor label, marking a short-lived reunion between Sedaka and RCA. Good friend and New York music impresario <a href="Don_Kirshner" title="Don Kirshner">Don Kirshner</a> attempted to make the U.S. release of <i>Emergence</i> a comeback for Sedaka, but the album and single releases had no appreciable success.

<p>Sedaka returned to the U.S. album charts with the release of <i><a href="Sedaka's_Back" title="Sedaka's Back">Sedaka's Back</a></i>, a compilation of songs from three albums he had already recorded in the UK—namely "Solitaire," "The Tra-La Days Are Over," and "Laughter in the Rain." It was only the second Sedaka album ever to chart in the U.S. Sedaka was known principally as a singles artist up to that point in his career; his only other American charting album was <i><a href="Neil_Sedaka_Sings_His_Greatest_Hits" title="Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits">Neil Sedaka Sings His Greatest Hits</a></i>, a compilation of his early singles.</p>
<p>Although the single was released in the autumn of 1974 and was very slow in building in sales and at radio, eventually Sedaka found himself once again topping the <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> Hot 100 singles chart (February 1, 1975) with "<a href="Laughter_in_the_Rain" title="Laughter in the Rain">Laughter in the Rain</a>." It was Sedaka's second No. 1 single thus far at that point in his career (after 1962's original version of "<a href="Breaking_Up_Is_Hard_to_Do" title="Breaking Up Is Hard to Do">Breaking Up Is Hard to Do</a>") and solidly reestablished Sedaka's popularity in America.</p>
<p>One of Sedaka's most well-received compositions during this period was the second single, "<a href="The_Immigrant_(Neil_Sedaka_song)" title="The Immigrant (Neil Sedaka song)">The Immigrant</a>" (US pop No. 22, US AC No. 1). Critics hailed its beautiful orchestration and evocative lyrics: wistful, nostalgic, and no doubt enhanced and embellished by both pride and disillusion with the state of affairs in the contemporary life in the nation in which Sedaka was raised. It was at one time welcoming of strangers from afar, willing to allow emigrants from faraway lands to enter our shores as immigrants, being allowed to try to find a place in that new home of their dreams – possibly not necessarily as perfect as initially hoped – but still the great land called America.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> But it was also was a protest ode dedicated to his friend (ironically, a former Beatle who had shooed him across the Atlantic in the opposite direction), <a href="John_Lennon" title="John Lennon">John Lennon</a>.</p>
<p>The third consecutive Billboard Top 25 hit from <i>Sedaka's Back</i> was the uptempo rocker "That's When the Music Takes Me" (US pop No. 25, US AC No. 7), originally from the 1972 <i>Solitaire</i> album. This song was a rarity at the time as it was one of the few songs Sedaka had written by himself, without a collaborator. It remains today his standard curtain-call concert closer.</p>
<p>In the US, Sedaka's records were issued first on the <a href="Rocket_Records" title="Rocket Records">Rocket</a> label (1974–77) and on the <a href="Elektra_Records" title="Elektra Records">Elektra</a> label (1977–81).</p>

According to <i>The Carpenters: The Untold Story</i> by <a href="Ray_Coleman" title="Ray Coleman">Ray Coleman</a>, manager Sherwin Bash fired Sedaka at the request of <a href="Richard_Carpenter_(musician)" title="Richard Carpenter (musician)">Richard Carpenter</a>, allegedly because Sedaka was becoming more popular than the Carpenters.

Richard Carpenter denied that he fired Sedaka for "stealing their show," as was the widespread rumour; Richard Carpenter responded that he and Karen were proud of Sedaka's success. However, Bash was fired as The Carpenters' manager a short time after.</p>

<p>In late 1975, Sedaka's most successful year of his career continued as he earned yet more chart success with the release of his second Rocket Records album, <i><a href="The_Hungry_Years" title="The Hungry Years">The Hungry Years</a></i>. This album was an American edition of Sedaka's British Polydor album "Overnight Success." The first single, "<a href="Bad_Blood_(Neil_Sedaka_song)" title="Bad Blood (Neil Sedaka song)" class="mw-redirect">Bad Blood</a>," hit No. 1 on the Billboard 100 and stayed there for three weeks (October 11, 18, and 25, 1975), was certified Gold<sup>®</sup> by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), and was the most individual commercially successful single of his career. Elton John provided uncredited backing vocals for "Bad Blood." Despite their later falling out that would result in a change from Sedaka's record label from Elton's Rocket Records to Elektra, Elton has been credited by Sedaka as being responsible for his breakthrough back into the U.S. pop music scene.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> Elton has been quoted as saying: "I only appear on the records of people I really know or like."<sup id="cite_ref-elton.2Fref_8-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-elton.2Fref-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Another highlight from "The Hungry Years" was Sedaka's new version of "<a href="Breaking_Up_Is_Hard_to_Do_(song)" title="Breaking Up Is Hard to Do (song)" class="mw-redirect">Breaking Up Is Hard to Do</a>." His 1962 original, a No. 1 hit single, was an upbeat pop song, while the remake was a jazz ballad, based on a similar arrangement by a Lenny Welch 1970 recording. Sedaka's version hit No. 8 on the Hot 100 in early 1976, making him the only artist to ever record entirely reworked and rearranged versions of the same song to both reach the Billboard Top 10. The 1976 ballad version also hit No. 1 on Billboard's <a href="Adult_Contemporary" title="Adult Contemporary" class="mw-redirect">Adult Contemporary</a> chart.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Neil_Sedaka&action=edit&section=19.php.html" title="Edit section: Transition from Rocket to Elektra">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Transition_from_Rocket_to_Elektra">Transition from Rocket to Elektra</span></h3>
<p>Later in 1976, Sedaka released a third (and final) album with Elton John's Rocket Records, <i><a href="Steppin'_Out_(Neil_Sedaka_album)" title="Steppin' Out (Neil Sedaka album)">Steppin' Out</a></i>. The first single, "Love in the Shadows," was an uncharacteristeringly solid rock song featuring a scorching guitar solo. While it peaked at #16 on the Hot 100, it was the first of his three "comeback" albums' debut singles to not hit #1--or even the Top 10, for that matter. Once again, but for the last time, Sedaka and Elton John collaborated, with Elton receiving uncredited backing vocals. The single was on the album's title track, "Steppin' Out. While it would crack the Top 40, it would also signal the beginning of a slowdown in Sedaka's music sales and radio play not unlike what he experienced in 1964 when The Beatles and the "British Invasion" arrived. In this version of another fading of his music sales, it was the arrival of the disco era. In 1977, Sedaka, now with <a href="Elektra_Records" title="Elektra Records">Elektra Records</a>, released his next album <i>"A Song,"</i> which had moderate success. Things got worse with his 1978 album <i>"All You Need Is the Music,"</i> which was a dismal failure, because as Sedaka attempted to release disco-themed music himself in the late 1970s, his album sales were weak and singles could not get a foothold on the radio. However, on one track of <i>"All You Need Is the Music"</i> was a beautiful ballad called "Should've Never Let Her Go." Sedaka released the song but it was not a success. In his next album, 1980's <i><a href="In_the_Pocket_(Neil_Sedaka_album)" title="In the Pocket (Neil Sedaka album)">In the Pocket</a></i>, he released an early single in the autumn of 1979, "Letting Go," which peaked just above the Hot 100. For the second single in the winter of 1980, Sedaka changed the lyrics and title to "Should've Never Let <i>You</i> Go," and re-recorded the song with his then-17-year-old daughter, Dara. As Sedaka explained in a 2006 London concert, their father-daughter duo would join only <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank</a> and <a href="Nancy_Sinatra" title="Nancy Sinatra">Nancy Sinatra</a>, and <a href="Nat_%22King%22_Cole" title="Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole" class="mw-redirect">Nat "King"</a> (posthumously) and <a href="Natalie_Cole" title="Natalie Cole">Natalie Cole</a> (via recording manipulation in "<a href="../../w/index-title=Unforgettable_(Natalie_Cole_and_Nat_%22King%22_Cole)&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Unforgettable (Natalie Cole and Nat &quot;King&quot; Cole) (page does not exist)">Unforgettable</a>", 1991, to achieve a "duet") to ever have father-daughter duets to reach the Top 40 on the Hot 100. Neil and Dara's pairing would return Neil to the Top 20 for his last Hot 100 charted single, but also the Top 5 on the Adult Contemporary Chart. The pair would have some modest, short-term success on the Adult Contemporary Chart success in the early 1980s, but by 1985, Sedaka was once again without a recording contract.</p>

<p>Throughout the 1970s, Sedaka's old record company, RCA, would re-issue his 1960s-era songs on several compilation LPs on the RCA Victor and <a href="RCA_Camden" title="RCA Camden">RCA Camden</a> labels, a practice which continues to this day. The idea was to capitalize on Sedaka's newfound popularity by making his RCA-era recordings available to younger generations of fans.</p>
<p>Sedaka also released one final album of new material with RCA, consisting of a live concert he gave in <a href="Sydney,_Australia" title="Sydney, Australia" class="mw-redirect">Sydney, Australia</a>. The album was released on the RCA International label in Australia and Europe as <i><a href="Neil_Sedaka_On_Stage" title="Neil Sedaka On Stage">Neil Sedaka On Stage</a></i> in 1974. It saw a US release on the <a href="RCA_Victor" title="RCA Victor" class="mw-redirect">RCA Victor</a> label in 1976 as <i>Sedaka Live In Australia</i>. The songs on the album were mostly cover versions of rock and pop songs from the previous twenty-five years, such as "<a href="Proud_Mary" title="Proud Mary">Proud Mary</a>", "<a href="Everything_Is_Beautiful" title="Everything Is Beautiful">Everything Is Beautiful</a>", and "The Father Of Girls."</p>
<p>RCA and Sedaka have been at odds for decades over ownership rights over Sedaka's original master tapes from his late 1950s/early 1960s hits. RCA has released assorted repackaging of his old hits, forcing Sedaka to re-record his old hits and make them sound as close and authentic to the originals as possible.</p>

<p>A change in record companies in the early 1980s also required him to, for the first time in his career, record cover versions of other artists' "oldies". Only two singles on two albums, spaced three years apart, managed to land on Billboard's Adult Contemporary chart; none charted on the Hot 100 at all. Another duet with Dara, a remake of the <a href="Marvin_Gaye" title="Marvin Gaye">Marvin Gaye</a>-<a href="Tammi_Terrell" title="Tammi Terrell">Tammi Terrell</a> 1967 Top 5 smash "<a href="Your_Precious_Love" title="Your Precious Love">Your Precious Love</a>", placed high enough on the AC chart (making the Top 15) for one final album to be released. But the second album's only release did not fare well on the AC chart, barely cracking its Top 40, and by 1985, Sedaka was once again without a recording contract. Concertgoers filled theatre seats while Sedaka created his own music label. That would assure that his catalog of hits would find the marketplace, and he released occasional CDs of self-produced new, original material.</p>

<p>In May 2003, near the end of the second season of the <a href="Fox_Broadcasting_Company" title="Fox Broadcasting Company">Fox</a> TV series <i><a href="American_Idol" title="American Idol">American Idol</a></i>, Sedaka appeared as a guest judge and mentor to the five remaining finalists. (The "guest judge" aspect of the series has long since been discontinued.) Several of the contestants' performances from Sedaka's songbook sparked particular praise from the guest judge. One of those performances came from eventual third-place finalist <a href="Kimberley_Locke" title="Kimberley Locke">Kimberley Locke</a>, who sang the "Theme from <i><a href="Where_the_Boys_Are" title="Where the Boys Are">Where the Boys Are</a></i>." The Sedaka/Greenfield composition was originally recorded by <a href="Connie_Francis" title="Connie Francis">Connie Francis</a> and has gone on to become her signature song. Sedaka termed Locke's performance "ear-licious."</p>
<p>Eventual Season 2 runnerup <a href="Clay_Aiken" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a> chose Sedaka's 1972 song "<a href="Solitaire_(Neil_Sedaka_song)" title="Solitaire (Neil Sedaka song)">Solitaire</a>" for his performance. As Aiken explained to the studio and TV audiences, host <a href="Ryan_Seacrest" title="Ryan Seacrest">Ryan Seacrest</a>, and the four total judges, "Solitaire" had long been one of his mother's all-time favorite songs. When she learned that Sedaka was going to be a guest judge and that the finalists would be singing Sedaka's songs, she begged him to sing "Solitaire." The performance was uniformly given extraordinarily high praise by the judges (including perennial skeptic <a href="Simon_Cowell" title="Simon Cowell">Simon Cowell</a>). Sedaka dissolved into tears, telling Aiken that he officially passed ownership of the performance of "Solitaire" to Clay, offering to record and produce a single of the song or an entire CD with him.</p>
<p>Although it did not appear on his debut CD itself, Aiken recorded and added "Solitaire" as the B-side to the single "<a href="The_Way/Solitaire" title="The Way/Solitaire">The Way</a>," whose sales were faltering. "Solitaire" was quickly moved to the A-side, and radio airplay and single and download sales responded immediately. "<a href="Solitaire_(Neil_Sedaka_song)" title="Solitaire (Neil Sedaka song)">Solitaire</a>" hit No. 1 on the <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> Hot Singles Sales chart and was, in fact, the top-selling single for all of 2004. It also hit the Top 5 on <i>Billboard'</i>s Hot 100. Sedaka was invited back to <i>American Idol</i> to celebrate the success of "Solitaire" several times, as it continued to reach new milestones. Since then, Aiken has mined the Sedaka songbook again, recording a cover of probably Sedaka's best-known song, "<a href="Breaking_Up_Is_Hard_to_Do_(song)" title="Breaking Up Is Hard to Do (song)" class="mw-redirect">Breaking Up Is Hard to Do</a>," on the "deluxe version" of his 2010 CD release, <i><a href="Tried_and_True" title="Tried and True">Tried and True</a></i>.</p>

<p>When Sedaka moved his family to the UK, British singer <a href="Tony_Christie" title="Tony Christie">Tony Christie</a> recorded and released the Sedaka/Greenfield composition "<a href="../(Is_This_the_Way_to)_Amarillo/index-.html" title="(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?" class="mw-redirect">(Is This the Way to) Amarillo?</a>" in 1971. The song did relatively well on the UK singles chart, peaking in the Top 20. It lay dormant for more than three decades, when UK comic <a href="Peter_Kay" title="Peter Kay">Peter Kay</a> <a href="Lip-synched" title="Lip-synched" class="mw-redirect">lip-synched</a> it for a 2002 video in his TV series <i><a href="Peter_Kay's_Phoenix_Nights" title="Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights" class="mw-redirect">Peter Kay's Phoenix Nights</a></i>. For the 2005 annual <a href="Comic_Relief" title="Comic Relief">Comic Relief</a> charity drive, he solicited a number of celebrity friends of his and updated the video, and it became an enormous hit. The original 1971 Tony Christie single was re-released to radio and CD/download sales, and hit No. 1 for seven weeks and was the biggest hit in Britain for all of 2005.</p>
<p>When interviewed for an "extras" feature for a DVD set of a concert filmed in London on 7 April 2006 (see below), Sedaka jokingly had heard that Christie had retired and was "golfing in Spain."<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> The sudden revival of "Amarillo" summoned Christie back to the UK for an unexpected return to fame.

In early 2006, the song received new life yet again when it received a dance beat and revised lyrics to become a novelty hit for the UK team's FIFA World Cup finals with "Is This the Way to the (England) World Cup?"

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Neil_Sedaka&action=edit&section=26.php.html" title="Edit section: New recording contract, new chart success">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="New_recording_contract.2C_new_chart_success">New recording contract, new chart success</span></h3>
<p>Since Sedaka had lost his recording contract in the mid-1980s, he had used his own business, Neil Sedaka Music, to finance the recording, production, and distribution of new CDs and repackaging of his existing catalog of music. Because of ongoing disputes with <a href="RCA_Victor_Records" title="RCA Victor Records" class="mw-redirect">RCA Victor Records</a> over the ownership of Sedaka's original late 1950s/early 1960s hits, in 1991, Sedaka re-recorded those early recordings, note-for-note. Sedaka had taken meticulous care of his voice over the years and still sang in the original keys recorded in his youth (and still does today). This allowed him to repackage his catalog to include both his early recordings along with his mid- to late 1970s hits and later recordings.</p>
<p>In early 2007, Sedaka signed his first recording contract in more than two decades with <a href="Razor_and_Tie_Records" title="Razor and Tie Records" class="mw-redirect">Razor and Tie Records</a>, a small-but-growing, New York-based independent label with a talent roster that also includes <a href="Joan_Baez" title="Joan Baez">Joan Baez</a>, <a href="Vanessa_Carlton" title="Vanessa Carlton">Vanessa Carlton</a>, <a href="Foreigner_(band)" title="Foreigner (band)">Foreigner</a>, <a href="Joe_Jackson_(musician)" title="Joe Jackson (musician)">Joe Jackson</a>, and <a href="Ladysmith_Black_Mambazo" title="Ladysmith Black Mambazo">Ladysmith Black Mambazo</a>. The first release was <i>The Definitive Collection</i>, a life-spanning compilation of his hits, along with outtakes and songs previously released but unavailable in CD and/or download format. It debuted in the Top 25 on <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a>'</i>s Top 200 Albums chart in May 2007, one of the highest-charting albums of his entire career. Best known as a "singles artist," this album chart activity was considered a significant comeback for the veteran entertainer. The last time Sedaka had an album on the Top 200 albums chart was in 1980, with his 1979 album <i>In the Pocket</i> – when "Should've Never Let You Go," the 1980 duet with Sedaka and daughter Dara, was Sedaka's last Top 20 hit on the Hot 100 singles chart.</p>
<p><i>Waking Up Is Hard to Do</i> was Sedaka's next release with Razor and Tie, hitting the albums chart in May 2009. The CD was a children's album that used the melodies of many of Sedaka's best-known songs but changed the lyrics to fit, and hopefully have fun with, the everyday lives of babies and toddlers, along with their parents, grandparents, babysitters, and other caregivers. The CD title is an example. Lastly, <i>The Music of My Life</i> entered the albums chart in February 2010<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> and comprised almost all new material. The first track, "Do You Remember?," is Sedaka's first foray into spicy salsa and was produced by music producer, composer, and pianist <a href="David_Foster" title="David Foster">David Foster</a>. "Right or Wrong," co-written with original music partner <a href="Howard_Greenfield" title="Howard Greenfield">Howard Greenfield</a>, was done in traditional street-corner, layered doo-wop vocal harmonies with Sedaka overlaying his own voice to achieve the effect for which he was well known in his "early" heyday of the late 1950s and early 1960s. The final track, "You", has been previously released, but was remastered for this project and is often one of several titles dedicated to his wife and career guide of nearly 50 years, Leba. Neil Sedaka Music continues to be listed as co-producer along with Razor and Tie.</p>
<p>A concert performance on 26 October 2007 at the <a href="Lincoln_Center" title="Lincoln Center" class="mw-redirect">Lincoln Center</a> in New York City paid homage to the 50th anniversary of Sedaka's debut in show business. Music impresario (and producer for <i>The Music of My Life</i> track "Do You Remember?") David Foster served as emcee. Other guests included <a href="The_Captain_and_Tennille" title="The Captain and Tennille" class="mw-redirect">The Captain and Tennille</a>; <a href="Natalie_Cole" title="Natalie Cole">Natalie Cole</a>; <a href="Connie_Francis" title="Connie Francis">Connie Francis</a>; recording legend and decades-long Sedaka friend and former manager <a href="Don_Kirshner" title="Don Kirshner">Don Kirshner</a>; and new <i>Solitaire</i> "owner" <a href="Clay_Aiken" title="Clay Aiken">Clay Aiken</a>, among many others. Also in 2007, <a href="Donny_Osmond" title="Donny Osmond">Donny Osmond</a> released a CD, <i>Love Songs of the '70s</i>, which included a cover of Neil's 1975 #1 hit "<a href="Laughter_in_the_Rain" title="Laughter in the Rain">Laughter in the Rain</a>."</p>
<p>During his 2008 Australian tour, Sedaka premiered a new classical orchestral composition entitled "Joie de Vivre (Joy of Life)."<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup> Sedaka also toured <a href="The_Philippines" title="The Philippines" class="mw-redirect">The Philippines</a> for his May 17, 2008, concert at the <a href="Araneta_Coliseum" title="Araneta Coliseum" class="mw-redirect">Araneta Coliseum</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>20<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In early 2010, his original uptempo version of "Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" (performed by a group of uncredited singers) was being heard as the impetus for a series of insurance TV commercials, featuring actor <a href="Dennis_Haysbert" title="Dennis Haysbert">Dennis Haysbert</a> assuring that TV viewers not insured by <a href="Allstate" title="Allstate">Allstate</a> <i>can</i> break up with their current insurer without much ado at all.</p>
<p>On September 11, 2010, Sedaka performed to a public and TV audience at the Hyde Park, London, venue of the "Proms in the Park" for the BBC. The UK continues to be probably Sedaka's most welcoming nation, and has been since first moving his family there (temporarily) four decades ago. The irony of the place whose music scuttled his "first" career, namely the Beatles and the British Invasion, and yet has constantly welcomed him with open arms for more than 40 years, is not lost on him, he has stated in many interviews. Indeed, it was his work with the musicians who would, in a few years, become the hit-making group <a href="10cc" title="10cc">10cc</a> that brought him back to the U.S. as a major star with #1 hits and a number of other major Top 40 singles. The UK always takes up a major portion of Sedaka's touring year in the 21st century.</p>
<p>In early 2011, Sedaka recorded two duets ("Brighton" and "<a href="The_Immigrant" title="The Immigrant">The Immigrant</a>") with singer Jim Van Slyke for Van Slyke's Neil Sedaka tribute album, <i>The Sedaka Sessions</i>. LML Records released this album in August 2011.<sup id="cite_ref-21" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-21"><span>[</span>21<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
