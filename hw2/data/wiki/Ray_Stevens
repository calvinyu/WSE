<p>Starting in the 1970s, Stevens became a producer and studio musician on the <a href="Nashville,_Tennessee" title="Nashville, Tennessee">Nashville</a> scene. He recorded songs for <a href="Barnaby_Records" title="Barnaby Records">Barnaby Records</a> and <a href="Warner_Brothers" title="Warner Brothers" class="mw-redirect">Warner Brothers</a> during 1970–1979. Stevens' biggest hit in the <a href="United_States" title="United States">United States</a> was his gospel-inflected single "<a href="Everything_Is_Beautiful" title="Everything Is Beautiful">Everything Is Beautiful</a>" (1970). The single won a <a href="Grammy_Award" title="Grammy Award">Grammy Award</a>, was the theme song for his summer 1970 TV show, hit number one on both the pop and Adult-Contemporary charts, and marked his first time in the Top 40 on the country charts, peaking at number 39. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a <a href="Music_recording_sales_certification" title="Music recording sales certification">gold disc</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-The_Book_of_Golden_Discs_6-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-The_Book_of_Golden_Discs-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> His other 1970 singles were "America, Communicate With Me" and "Sunset Strip," both of which reached the Top 20 on the Adult-Contemporary lists. His novelty song "Bridget the Midget (The Queen of The Blues)" made number two on the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> chart in 1971 and in the US it reached number 50. Stevens had a gospel/country hit single in early 1972 with <a href="../Albert_E._Brumley" title="Albert E. Brumley">Albert E. Brumley</a>'s "<a href="../../w/index-title=Turn_Your_Radio_On&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Turn Your Radio On (page does not exist)">Turn Your Radio On</a>," reaching the country Top 20. Two more of Stevens' songs in 1971 were also minor pop hits, "A Mama and a Papa" and "All My Trials," but both crossed over to the Top 10 Adult-Contemporary lists. Stevens frequently toured Canada and went overseas to the UK. A rock-infected gospel arrangement accompanied his version of "Love Lifted Me" and it became a hit single in <a href="Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> in the fall of 1972, finding its way into the Top Five for the week ending September 30.</p>
<p>In 1973, Stevens had a top 40 country hit with the title track of his album, "Nashville," and increased his exposure on television by performing on a variety of prime-time programs of the era. In 1974, Stevens recorded perhaps his most famous hit, "<a href="The_Streak" title="The Streak">The Streak</a>," which poked fun at the early-1970s fad of running nude in public, known as "<a href="Streaking" title="Streaking">streaking</a>." It became number one in both the UK and the US and No.&#160;3 on the country chart. In 1975, he released the Grammy-winning "<a href="Misty_(song)" title="Misty (song)">Misty</a>," which became his biggest country hit (reaching number three on the country charts and number 14 on the pop charts); he also entered the country Top 40 with a doo-wop version of "<a href="Indian_Love_Call" title="Indian Love Call">Indian Love Call</a>," "<a href="../../w/index-title=Everybody_Needs_a_Rainbow&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Everybody Needs a Rainbow (page does not exist)">Everybody Needs a Rainbow</a>," and a ballad version of "<a href="Young_Love_(1956_song)" title="Young Love (1956 song)">Young Love</a>" in early 1976. Stevens' tenure with Barnaby came to an end in early 1976.</p>
<p>Stevens joined Warner Brothers in 1976, where his debut single was a cover of "<a href="You_Are_So_Beautiful" title="You Are So Beautiful">You Are So Beautiful</a>," which reached the country Top 20, then "<a href="../../w/index-title=Honky_Tonk_Waltz&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Honky Tonk Waltz (page does not exist)">Honky Tonk Waltz</a>," which reached the Top 30. He then released a novelty single: under the pseudonym "Henhouse Five Plus Too," Stevens recorded a version of <a href="Glenn_Miller" title="Glenn Miller">Glenn Miller</a>'s "<a href="In_The_Mood" title="In The Mood" class="mw-redirect">In The Mood</a>" in the style of a clucking chicken; it became a Top 40 hit in the US and UK in early 1977. In 1978 he had a hit with "<a href="Be_Your_Own_Best_Friend" title="Be Your Own Best Friend">Be Your Own Best Friend</a>" on the country charts, and in 1979 he had his last Hot 100 hit (to date) with the novelty "<a href="../../w/index-title=I_Need_Your_Help,_Barry_Manilow&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="I Need Your Help, Barry Manilow (page does not exist)">I Need Your Help, Barry Manilow</a>," which he released from the album <i>The Feeling's Not Right Again.</i> In the US, Stevens' singles would reach only the country chart nationally thereafter.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Ray_Stevens&action=edit&section=5.php.html" title="Edit section: 1980s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="1980s">1980s</span></h3>
<p>After joining RCA in 1980, he released "<a href="Shriner's_Convention" title="Shriner's Convention">Shriner's Convention</a>" and then "<a href="Night_Games" title="Night Games">Night Games</a>". In 1981, only one single made the charts, "One More Last Chance." In 1982, after he had released a few more singles, notably "Written Down in My Heart," Stevens left RCA and returned to Mercury Records. This resulted in only one album, the 1983 project <i>Me</i>, and only one chart hit, "My Dad," in early 1984.</p>
<p>Stevens then joined MCA in 1984 as a "country comedy" act and thereafter released only novelty song albums. The fan-voted Music City News awards named Stevens Comedian of the Year for nine consecutive years from 1986 to 1994. A few of Stevens' commercial singles charted on the Single Sales charts during this time, but only one single, "<a href="Mississippi_Squirrel_Revival" title="Mississippi Squirrel Revival" class="mw-redirect">Mississippi Squirrel Revival</a>," made it to the Top 40, making that his final single to hit the Top-40 portion of the country singles chart. During his 1984–1989 stint on MCA, the single "Would Jesus Wear a Rolex" stalled at number 41 in 1987.</p>
<p>His first two albums for MCA reached the Top-5 with <i>I Have Returned</i> hitting the top spot in early 1986. A 1987 <i>Greatest Hits</i> album became a <a href="Platinum" title="Platinum">platinum</a> seller, while several other releases achieved gold status. One of the trademarks of Stevens' string of comedy albums were the photo shoots. For example, on one album he's dressed up as <a href="Napoleon_Bonaparte" title="Napoleon Bonaparte" class="mw-redirect">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, on another he's <a href="Humpty_Dumpty" title="Humpty Dumpty">Humpty Dumpty</a>, and on another he's dressed as General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="Douglas MacArthur">Douglas MacArthur</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Ray_Stevens&action=edit&section=6.php.html" title="Edit section: 1990s">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="1990s">1990s</span></h3>
<p>Stevens left MCA in 1989 for Curb/Capitol Records. The two labels split up soon after and Curb Records continued releasing material on Stevens. <i>His All-Time Greatest Comic Hits</i>, a compilation project released by Curb in 1990, became a gold album by mid-decade. <i>Lend Me Your Ears</i> and <i>Number One With a Bullet</i> were released in 1990 and 1991 respectively. The latter featured the satirical hit "Working for the Japanese" in which Stevens sings about the <a href="Economy_of_the_United_States" title="Economy of the United States">American economy</a> and how dollars are boosting overseas economies instead of its own.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, Stevens took new directions. The most ambitious was the opening of his own theater in <a href="Branson,_Missouri" title="Branson, Missouri">Branson, Missouri</a> in 1991. The theater business had been steadily growing in the small Missouri town of Branson for a period of years and by the time Stevens began building his theater the area was reaching its peak. Stevens benefited from the theater boom largely because his <a href="Stage_show" title="Stage show" class="mw-redirect">stage show</a> was different from others. His reputation as a comedian and as an all-around entertainer meant that for most tourists his show was one of the destination spots judging by the number of sold-out performances he gave at the theater. When crowds reacted favorably to his music videos being played on a large screen at his theater Stevens began selling videos for his fans to take home.</p>
<p>In the spring and summer of 1992, his <i><a href="../../w/index-title=Comedy_Video_Classics&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Comedy Video Classics (page does not exist)">Comedy Video Classics</a></i> became a million-selling home video through <a href="Direct_marketing" title="Direct marketing">direct marketing</a> and <a href="Television_advertisements" title="Television advertisements" class="mw-redirect">television advertisements</a>. Commercials for Stevens' home video aired countless times throughout 1992, mostly in the morning hours and often during late-night. Branson was also experiencing its highest commercial peak in the summer and fall of both 1992 and 1993. Ray Stevens was back in the national media once again with his enormously successful home video and music theater. In the midst of all the success, though, Stevens closed down his theater after the 1993 season citing exhaustion and monotony after doing two shows a day, six days a week, for five to six months at a time. Several of his performances at his theater were filmed and surfaced in home video form. <i>Ray Stevens Live!</i> became another home video mail-order success in 1993 following the same path of <i>Comedy Video Classics</i>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <i>Comedy Video Classics</i> had become available for retail distribution and it became a big seller again. In 1993, it was named Home Video of the Year by <i><a href="Billboard_(magazine)" title="Billboard (magazine)">Billboard</a></i> magazine in their annual end of the year publication which cites the most popular artists, songs, CDs, and video items of the year.</p>
<p><i>Classic Ray Stevens</i> was issued in the early fall of 1993. This was the first audio release from Stevens since early 1991. The album's title was a reference to the classical-looking photo shoot which features a bust of Ray Stevens mocking <a href="Beethoven" title="Beethoven" class="mw-redirect">Beethoven</a>. The home video of <i>Ray Stevens Live!</i> was released to retail stores in 1994 and it became a Top-5 success on Billboard's Home Video chart. The concert video often ranked above or below <i>Comedy Video Classics</i> on the charts. In the late summer of 1995, the movie <i>Get Serious!</i> was released on home video.</p>
<p>The movie, which runs 1 hour and 50 minutes, offers several plots and a collection of newly-produced music videos which act as commentary to the action. One <a href="Plot_point" title="Plot point">plot point</a> of the movie centers on a fictional record company for which Stevens records being bought out by a Japanese conglomerate. This is a reference to the <a href="Consolidation_(business)" title="Consolidation (business)">consolidation</a> practices taking place in the music industry. Another plot-point deals with Stevens' reputation as a comical singer and how the new executive of the fictional record company, based vocally on <a href="Paul_Lynde" title="Paul Lynde">Paul Lynde</a>, wants Stevens to change his image from comedy to classical opera. Stevens refuses and this brings to the surface another plot-point of the movie: political correctness. Seeking revenge on Stevens, the executive hatches a plan to ruin Stevens’ career by labeling him politically incorrect. The last plot-point centers on character defamation as numerous characters from several Stevens songs turn out to really exist and they want to sue the singer for defamation. This plot is based on a song that Stevens recorded in 1986 entitled "Dudley Dorite of the Highway Patrol" where a local policeman stops Stevens for speeding and afterward informs the singer that he's in a whole lot of trouble for using easily identifiable people as characters in his songs. The song was re-recorded specifically for the movie as Dudley Dorite is one of the main characters in the movie. He's portrayed by Stevens' long-time songwriting partner, <a href="../../w/index-title=C.W._Kalb,_Jr.&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="C.W. Kalb, Jr. (page does not exist)">C.W. Kalb, Jr.</a>.</p>
<p>The home video became another mail-order success throughout 1995 and was released to retail stores, via MCA, late in 1996. The video hit the Top-5 on Billboard's Home Video chart early in 1997 during a more than 20 week chart run. Stevens had by this point exited Curb Records.</p>
<p>Stevens found a new home with his previous label, MCA. MCA was responsible for the retail distribution of <i>Get Serious!</i> and for marketing Ray as a comical singer for the first time in the mid-1980s.</p>
<p>The reunion with MCA consisted of the retail release of <i>Get Serious!</i> in late 1996 and two new audio CD's in 1997: <i><a href="Hum_It" title="Hum It">Hum It</a></i> and <i>Christmas Through a Different Window</i>, the latter release being a collection of Christmas novelty songs. After the MCA contract ended, Stevens became exclusive to his own label, Clyde Records, for a period of years.</p>
<p>On-line rumors began circulating about his death. The confusion may have arisen in the summer of 1996 following the death of a wrestler named <a href="Ray_%22The_Crippler%22_Stevens" title="Ray &quot;The Crippler&quot; Stevens" class="mw-redirect">Ray "The Crippler" Stevens</a>. The singer Ray Stevens once recorded a wrestling song entitled "The Blue Cyclone." Stevens, the singer, reported to the media that his office had received thousands of sympathy cards due to the confusion.</p>
<p>In April 1999 Stevens was diagnosed with early stage <a href="Prostate_cancer" title="Prostate cancer">prostate cancer</a> and had to cancel his series of concerts at the <a href="../../w/index-title=Acuff_Theatre&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Acuff Theatre (page does not exist)">Acuff Theatre</a> that summer. Stevens received a clean bill of health upon successful surgery and returned to the stage in time to deliver his Christmas concert series.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Ray_Stevens&action=edit&section=7.php.html" title="Edit section: 2000s (2000–2009)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="2000s_.282000.E2.80.932009.29">2000s (2000–2009)</span></h3>
<p>After the partnership with MCA ended, he remained active on his own label, Clyde Records, until he found another home with Curb Records, returning to the label in 2001. Early in 2002, "<a href="../../w/index-title=Osama_Yo'_Mama&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Osama Yo' Mama (page does not exist)">Osama Yo' Mama</a>" was released. It made the country Top 50, reached the Top-5 on the country single sales chart, achieved Gold selling status, and the album of the same name reached the country Top-30. After the release of this album Stevens returned to Branson, Missouri and re-opened his theater in 2004. He remained active there for three more seasons. He shut the theater down for good after the 2006 season, selling it off to cable network <a href="RFD-TV" title="RFD-TV">RFD-TV</a>, which continues to operate it to this day.</p>
<p>An obscure release called "The New Battle of New Orleans" came along in 2005 as a response to the vandals and looters in the aftermath of <a href="Hurricane_Katrina" title="Hurricane Katrina">Hurricane Katrina</a>. Many people confused the version of <i>The New Battle of New Orleans</i> by its principal writer, <a href="../../w/index-title=Chuck_Redden&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Chuck Redden (page does not exist)">Chuck Redden</a>, with the version by Stevens. The recording by the writer features much more pointed accusations and assertions and it is this version which appears on various web-sites specializing in lyric re-printing. The confusion arises when these web-sites credit Stevens as the singer of that version.</p>
<p>Ray and his songwriter friend Buddy Kalb removed a lot of the original lyrics in the song and supplied new lyrics in a more G-rated setting. In spite of the various lyrical re-writes by Stevens and Kalb, the overall point of the song that the locals expected and demanded too much from their government, is still clear. The song was issued as a single-only in 2005.</p>
<p>Curb Records, in the meantime, continued to release DVD music video collections on Stevens during this time. The music videos featured limited animation.</p>
<p>Stevens returned to releasing music once again in 2007, firstly in July 2007, with the single-only "Ruby Falls," a combination of jazz, blues, and country music, and secondly with the CD <i>New Orleans Moon</i>, released on his own label. This CD contains various songs in tribute and honor to New Orleans and Louisiana. Stevens covers "<a href="Louisiana_Man" title="Louisiana Man">Louisiana Man</a>," "Louisiana," "<a href="The_Battle_of_New_Orleans" title="The Battle of New Orleans">The Battle of New Orleans</a>," "<a href="Way_Down_Yonder_in_New_Orleans" title="Way Down Yonder in New Orleans">Way Down Yonder in New Orleans</a>," "New Orleans," and several more.</p>
<p>The following year Stevens issued the album <i>Hurricane</i>, also on his own label. It was released in February 2008 at Stevens' on-line music store at his website then was released nationally in November of that year to a wider audience. This CD featured a wide array of comical songs including a pair of redneck anthems, "Hey Bubba, Watch This!" and "Bubba the Wine Connoisseur." The CD also marked the debut of "<a href="../../w/index-title=Sucking_Sound&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Sucking Sound (page does not exist)">Sucking Sound</a>," a political/economic song about <a href="Ross_Perot" title="Ross Perot">Ross Perot</a> and how his warnings of the flaws in a global economy, which were mocked in 1992, became somewhat of a reality by 2008, resulting in massive lay-offs and job losses.</p>
<p>Concurrently in 2008, a tribute to the songs of <a href="Frank_Sinatra" title="Frank Sinatra">Frank Sinatra</a> that Stevens recorded was also being offered at the web-site store during the latter half of 2008. The album is titled <i><a href="../../w/index-title=Ray_Stevens_Sings_Sinatra...Say_What??&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Ray Stevens Sings Sinatra...Say What?? (page does not exist)">Ray Stevens Sings Sinatra...Say What??</a></i> and it became nationally distributed in February 2009. Stevens did not promote or publicize the tribute album. Later in 2009 he released <i><a href="../../w/index-title=One_for_the_Road_(Ray_Stevens_album)&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="One for the Road (Ray Stevens album) (page does not exist)">One for the Road</a></i>, a CD aimed primarily at truckers. It was sold exclusively at the <a href="Pilot_Travel_Centers" title="Pilot Travel Centers" class="mw-redirect">Pilot</a> truck stops for several weeks prior to its release nationally. The CD contains a mixture of material ranging from truck driver oriented songs to somber ballads. There are also several re-recordings of his greatest hits added into the equation. There are fifteen tracks featured on the trucker CD in which the first three tracks, in addition to track seven, specifically deal with situations while on the road: "Concrete Sailor," "Convoy," "Right Reverend Road Hog McGraw," and "Hang Up and Drive." "Mary Lou Nights" and "<a href="Oh,_Lonesome_Me" title="Oh, Lonesome Me" class="mw-redirect">Oh, Lonesome Me</a>." "Retired" originated as a duet between Stevens and <a href="Brent_Burns" title="Brent Burns">Brent Burns</a> but for this CD it is delivered <a href="Solo_(music)" title="Solo (music)">solo</a>.</p>
<p>In 2009 Stevens was inducted into the Christian Music Hall of Fame and he appeared on the PBS series <i><a href="../../w/index-title=Legends_and_Lyrics&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Legends and Lyrics (page does not exist)">Legends and Lyrics</a></i>. A television show that Stevens stars in, <i>We Ain't Dead Yet</i>, became available to subscribers at his web page. The subscription is to an exclusive section of his web-page called "Ray Stevens Backstage" and each month a different episode becomes available. The series focuses on senior citizens and it usually features a special guest each episode stopping by the main set, a retirement home, to perform songs.</p>
<p>In the early fall of 2009 Stevens released a holiday collection of songs titled <i>Ray Stevens Christmas</i>. Late in November an <a href="Extended_play" title="Extended play">EP</a> became available featuring a couple of his serious Christmas songs but the main attraction was his cover of Seymour Swine's (a fictional group that recorded a stuttering rendition of "<a href="Blue_Christmas" title="Blue Christmas">Blue Christmas</a>") "Blue Christmas," complete with stutter. Stevens had also recorded a non-comical version of this song for his <i>Ray Stevens Christmas</i> release. The stuttering version can only be found on the EP release.</p>
<p>In December 2009, Stevens issued the single and on-line video "We the People," which quickly became a <a href="Viral_video" title="Viral video">viral video</a> and surpassed a million unique views in a month's time on <a href="YouTube" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>.

<p>On May 13, 2010, the music video of "Come to the USA" was released. This is a song dealing with the <a href="Hot_button" title="Hot button" class="mw-redirect">hot button</a> issue of <a href="Illegal_immigration" title="Illegal immigration">illegal immigration</a>. The song uses exaggeration and small doses of satire to comment on illegal immigration acceptance internationally compared with the United States’ more passive policy.

<p>Given the overall on-line popularity of his music videos on YouTube it enabled Stevens to reach a milestone in early September 2010. This milestone refers to the collective number of plays that all of his music videos had obtained up until that point in time. When the play totals for each officially-released music video were tallied the collective total reached ten million. "<a href="../../w/index-title=Come_to_the_USA&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Come to the USA (page does not exist)">Come to the USA</a>" obtained over four million YouTube unique views while "We the People" had obtained over three million.</p>

<p>On November 3, the day after the 2010 mid-term elections, Stevens uploaded a new music video on YouTube entitled "Nightmare Before Christmas." The song has nothing to do with politics or elections but instead deals with <a href="Political_correctness" title="Political correctness">political correctness</a> gone <a href="Running_amok" title="Running amok">amuck</a> as <a href="Santa_Claus" title="Santa Claus">Santa Claus</a> gets arrested and is charged with crimes against a politically correct society.

<p>On April 14 Stevens decided to end his subscription-based web-site, <i>Ray Stevens Backstage</i>, after a two-year run. The site was aimed at providing the most ardent of fans with exclusive content. Upon its cancellation it was revealed that elements of the <i>Backstage</i> site would be incorporated into the main Ray Stevens web-site. A classic music video from Ray uploaded on YouTube in 2009 but taped in 1992 entitled <i>The Mississippi Squirrel Revival</i> surpassed a million on-line views. This became the third music video from Stevens to obtain at least a million on-line views. On April 25 Stevens uploaded a new music video onto YouTube entitled "The Obama Budget Plan." A video clip was highlighted on <a href="The_O'Reilly_Factor" title="The O'Reilly Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>. The same day, April 25, Stevens released his latest collection of songs, <i>The Spirit of '76</i>, which contains the previously mentioned "Obama Budget Plan," "God Save Arizona," and "The Skies Just Ain't Friendly Anymore."</p>
<p>The collection was available in its earliest weeks of release in digital download format. By May 1, Stevens' "Obama Budget Plan" on-line music video had generated over 95,000 unique views in less than a week's time. Later that same night news broke on the death of <a href="Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a> and as a result Stevens' music video from 2002 entitled "Osama Yo' Mama," which was uploaded on YouTube in 2009, experienced a resurgence in on-line activity. The video had received more than 990,000 unique views prior to the news of bin Laden's death and in the aftermath it received more than 20,000 additional plays causing it to surpass a million on-line views and as a result it became his fourth music video to surpass a million plays.</p>
<p>On May 5 Stevens called the <a href="Lars_Larson" title="Lars Larson">Lars Larson</a> show on radio station <a href="KXL-FM" title="KXL-FM">KXL</a> to discuss current events. On May 11 he appeared at a conservative rally in <a href="Franklin,_Tennessee" title="Franklin, Tennessee">Franklin, Tennessee</a> billed as <i>Conservatives on the Move</i>. Stevens made the rounds of the <a href="Fox_Business_Network" title="Fox Business Network">Fox Business Network</a> in early June during a trip to New York to promote the Obama budget music video and his <i>Spirit of '76</i> collection. On June 2 Stevens made an appearance on <a href="../../w/index-title=America's_Nightly_Scoreboard&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="America's Nightly Scoreboard (page does not exist)">America's Nightly Scoreboard</a>, an economics program hosted by <a href="David_Asman" title="David Asman">David Asman</a> on the Fox Business Network.

Legendary session musicians and artists gathered to celebrate the studio's history, perform songs, and tell stories about the recording sessions.</p>
<p>After a low-key July, Stevens kicked off the month of August being interviewed on <a href="WSM_(AM)" title="WSM (AM)">WSM</a> radio. The interview took place on a program hosted by WSM <a href="DJ" title="DJ" class="mw-redirect">DJ</a> and <a href="Grand_Ole_Opry" title="Grand Ole Opry">Grand Ole Opry</a> announcer, Eddie Stubbs, titled <i>Intimate Evenings</i>. The interview aired on August 1. The 2-hour series airs from the <a href="Country_Music_Hall_of_Fame" title="Country Music Hall of Fame" class="mw-redirect">Country Music Hall of Fame</a>. The host played several of Ray's songs and often mentioned how packed the venue was and how electric the atmosphere felt. A lot of time was spent on Ray's past (his career, after all, goes back to 1957) but yet there was also discussion of Ray's current recordings and activity. Ray offered his opinions on politics and other topical issues...bringing chuckles and cheers from the host and from the audience. Several days later, on August 9, the CD copy of his digital release from April, <i>Spirit of '76</i>, was released to wider distribution. Previously the CD copy had only been available at the singer's web-site store.</p>
<p>On August 12 the "Obama Budget Plan" music video surpassed half a million views and by the middle of September it had surpassed 700,000 on-line views. On September 27 Stevens uploaded the music video, "Mr. President - Mr. President," and it quickly amassed more than 200,000 unique views in a little more than a week's time. A snippet of the video, during the first days of its YouTube availability, was previewed on <a href="The_O'Reilly_Factor" title="The O'Reilly Factor">The O'Reilly Factor</a>. On October 7 the song was heard on <a href="Mark_Levin" title="Mark Levin">Mark Levin</a>'s nationally syndicated radio program.

Stevens gave an interview for the radio series, <a href="American_Country_Countdown" title="American Country Countdown">American Country Countdown</a>, hosted by Nashville songwriter and half of the <a href="Brooks_and_Dunn" title="Brooks and Dunn" class="mw-redirect">Brooks and Dunn</a> duo, <a href="Kix_Brooks" title="Kix Brooks">Kix Brooks</a>.

The songs are part of <i>The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music</i>. Also on March 8 an article on Ray by a writer named Chuck Dauphin appeared on <a href="../Billboard.com" title="Billboard.com" class="mw-redirect">Billboard.com</a> detailing the Encyclopedia's contents. The article also included Ray's feelings about the lack of an abundance of comedy songs on contemporary radio stations, the comedy song's lack of respect, and the unfounded stigma that exists about comedy songs.</p>
<p>April 5 saw the YouTube release of a live version of "We The People" recorded in Branson, Missouri during one of his series of concerts. The video's gotten more than 7,500 views with hardly any promotional hype behind it. A day later on April 6 a fast-paced four-minute commercial was uploaded onto YouTube promoting the Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music. The commercial features Buddy Kalb, one of Ray's business associates and songwriters, as well as Ray giving detail about the box set. On April 10 Stevens appeared on <a href="Fox_and_Friends" title="Fox and Friends" class="mw-redirect">Fox and Friends</a> and performed a brief medley of some of the songs on the Encyclopedia. Afterwards he appeared on their "After the Show show", and discussed more about the Encyclopedia and performed "Mississippi Squirrel Revival" in its entirety. Later that evening Stevens was a guest on the Fox Across America radio program hosted by Spencer Hughes. On April 14 Stevens was featured on the country music interview and lifestyle program, <a href="Crook_and_Chase" title="Crook and Chase" class="mw-redirect">Crook and Chase</a>.

Prior to this, Lindsey made a cameo appearance in Stevens' 1995 <a href="Direct-to-video" title="Direct-to-video">direct-to-video</a> movie, <i>Get Serious!</i>. Stevens attended George Lindsey's funeral on May 11 and performed <i>"Everything Is Beautiful"</i>.</p>
<p>On the music product side of things, Stevens issued a couple of CD and DVD packages in the summer of 2012. A concert collection titled <i>Such a Night: 50 Years of Hits and Hilarity</i> and <i>Patriots and Politics</i> were issued in both CD and DVD formats. A third DVD release, <i>Get Serious!</i>, was a re-issue of Stevens' 1995 direct-to-video movie. It marked the first time it had been issued on DVD.</p>
<p>On July 23 Stevens uploaded a new music video titled "Obama Nation" which examined the goals, priorities, and policies of the President since taking office in January 2009. The video obtained more than half a million on-line views a month later on August 24, 2012. "Obama Budget Plan", in the meantime, had surpassed 2,000,000 unique views by the fall of 2012. On November 3, 2012 Stevens uploaded the music video, "Grandpa Voted Democrat", a song that deals with the issue of <a href="Voter_fraud" title="Voter fraud" class="mw-redirect">voter fraud</a>. The video was uploaded just days before Election Day 2012 and has gotten more than 185,000 unique views as of January 2013. The outcome of the 2012 election saw the Republicans keep control of the <a href="United_States_House_of_Representatives" title="United States House of Representatives">House of Representatives</a> and the Democrats remained in control of the <a href="United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senate</a> and the <a href="White_House" title="White House">White House</a>. Obama was re-elected through the electoral college process while narrowly defeating <a href="Mitt_Romney" title="Mitt Romney">Mitt Romney</a> in popular votes. "Obama Nation", while all of this was going on, had gained more than 250,000 additional unique views to bring it's total by election day to more than 770,000 online views.</p>
<p>On December 3, 2012 Stevens issued a non-comical music video in the form of "White Christmas". He had recorded this for a non-comical project he released in 2009 titled <i>Ray Stevens Christmas</i>. On December 11 Stevens released a second seasonal music video, his comical version of "Blue Christmas". This video's availability was an exclusive on <a href="AOL" title="AOL">AOL</a>'s web-site, <a href="The_Boot" title="The Boot">The Boot</a>. Ten days later, on December 21, it was available on YouTube. It was around this same time period that Stevens appeared on the local FOX television station in Nashville to promote <i>The Encyclopedia of Recorded Comedy Music</i> as well as perform a medley of Christmas songs. A third seasonal video, "Redneck Christmas", arrived on December 22. This song goes back to Ray's first Christmas release in 1997. This marked the debut of its official music video.</p>
<p>A fourth seasonal music video, "Merry Christmas", also debuted on December 22. "Merry Christmas" took a pointed look at a certain segment of society and its obsession with political correctness and a media that collectively marginalizes the religious aspects of the holiday. The video struck a chord with people and overshadowed the three other seasonal music videos. "Merry Christmas" quickly obtained more than 100,000 online views within several hours of its debut and in the days leading up to Christmas. The three seasonal music videos that were released prior to "Merry Christmas" haven't risen above the 100,000 plateau yet. Interest in those music videos were obviously placed on hold while the socially provocative "Merry Christmas" was getting all the attention.</p>
<p>Amidst the seasonal music video releases that took up the month of December 2012, <a href="The_Nashville_Network" title="The Nashville Network">The Nashville Network</a> had by that time been re-launched as a digital television <a href="../../w/index-title=Sub-channel&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Sub-channel (page does not exist)">sub-channel</a>. The actual re-launch was at the beginning of November 2012. This event eventually led to Stevens becoming the host of a television series that he titled <i>RAY-ality TV</i>. The series, which airs on the re-launched Nashville Network at 9pm Eastern/8pm Central on Sunday nights, is a program filled with video clips from Stevens' vast video catalog interwoven with newer video footage as well as scenes that had been taped for numerous home video projects that, for whatever reason, were left on the cutting room floor.</p>
<p>A promo for this series was uploaded onto YouTube on January 9, 2013. The re-launched Nashville Network has limited availability and there is no on-line video stream.</p>

Years later fans from all over the country could call and vote for their favorite acts in addition to the subscribers who used voting ballots. The winners of the fan voted awards were showcased nationally in an awards gala broadcast on <a href="CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a> and later, <a href="The_Nashville_Network" title="The Nashville Network">The Nashville Network</a>. Stevens won in the Comedian of the Year category nine consecutive years and performed on their awards telecasts on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>Stevens was the recipient of several publisher awards from BMI Music for songs he either wrote, recorded, or published. Some of the recordings that received these citations were <i>Everything Is Beautiful</i>, <i>The Streak</i>, <i>Shriner's Convention</i>, <i>Gitarzan</i>, and several songs recorded by <a href="Sammy_Kershaw" title="Sammy Kershaw">Sammy Kershaw</a> and published by Stevens.</p>
<p>In July 2009 Stevens began uploading music videos onto YouTube for the first time. Many of the uploads were of music videos that were made in the early and mid-1990s. His user name, raystevensmusic, has since released quite a few music videos on YouTube and by late summer of 2010, a combined total of 10,000,000 unique views was obtained.</p>
