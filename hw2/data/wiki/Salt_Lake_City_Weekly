<p>John Saltas founded what would become <i>Salt Lake City Weekly</i> in June 1984. He called his monthly publication the <i>Private Eye</i> because it contained news and promotions for bars and dance clubs, which due to Utah State liquor laws were all private clubs. Saltas originally mailed the <i>Private Eye</i> as a newsletter to private club members. State law forbade private clubs from advertising at the time, so Saltas' newsletter was the only way for clubs to get promotional information out.</p>
<p>In 1988, the <i>Private Eye</i> became a bi-weekly newspaper although it was available mostly in clubs. Distribution of the paper broadened as new liquor rule interpretations at the <a href="Utah_Department_of_Alcoholic_Beverage_Control" title="Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control">Utah Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control</a> (DABC) allowed mainstream media to carry club advertisements as long as they weren't "soliciting" members. The "Private Eye" thus ended its mailed period and was available for free in public distribution outlets for the first time. In 1989, Private Eye was admitted to the <a href="Association_of_Alternative_Newsweeklies" title="Association of Alternative Newsweeklies" class="mw-redirect">Association of Alternative Newsweeklies</a> (AAN), the organization's 40th member.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_leaving_2-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Walsh_leaving-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Salt_Lake_City_Weekly&action=edit&section=2.php.html" title="Edit section: Private Eye Weekly">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Private_Eye_Weekly"><i>Private Eye Weekly</i></span></h3>
<p>In 1992 the <i>Private Eye Weekly</i> emerged as a weekly <a href="Tabloid_(newspaper_format)" title="Tabloid (newspaper format)">tabloid</a>-style alternative paper with distribution outlets in Salt Lake City, Ogden, Park City and Utah County. Saltas hired his first editor, then-<a href="KSL-TV" title="KSL-TV">KSL-TV</a> journalist Tom Walsh. Walsh was a veteran writer with experience from the alternative <i><a href="Phoenix_New_Times" title="Phoenix New Times">Phoenix New Times</a></i>, and he took a significant salary cut because of his enthusiasm for the new paper.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_leaving_2-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Walsh_leaving-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <i>Private Eye</i>'s early contributors included Ben Fulton (who served as editor in chief until spring 2007), Christopher Smart (currently a reporter for <i><a href="The_Salt_Lake_Tribune" title="The Salt Lake Tribune">The Salt Lake Tribune</a></i>), Mary Dickson, Katharine Biele, Lynn Packer, and notable Utah defense <a href="Lawyer" title="Lawyer">attorney</a> <a href="../../w/index-title=Ron_Yengich&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Ron Yengich (page does not exist)">Ron Yengich</a>.</p>
<p>From 1992 onward, reporter Lynn Packer <a href="Scoop_(term)" title="Scoop (term)">scooped</a> many stories about then-Salt Lake City Mayor <a href="Deedee_Corradini" title="Deedee Corradini">Deedee Corradini</a>, and Bonneville Pacific, an energy company.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> Ron Yengich's relationship with the paper would end days after he was retained as Corradini's attorney in 1996. Yengich had mocked the mayor in a <i>Private Eye</i> column just days before becoming her representative.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In June 1996, Tom Walsh resigned from the paper to become an executive of another alternative weekly, the <i><a href="Miami_New_Times" title="Miami New Times">Miami New Times</a></i>.<sup id="cite_ref-Walsh_leaving_2-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Walsh_leaving-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup> The <i>Private Eye</i> hosted the annual AAN convention May 29–31, 1996, after Walsh had already announced his resignation.</p>
<p>During 1996 the <i>Private Eye Weekly</i>'s page count outgrew independent Salt Lake City presses, so the paper made printing arrangements with the publisher of the <i><a href="Ogden_Standard-Examiner" title="Ogden Standard-Examiner" class="mw-redirect">Ogden Standard-Examiner</a></i>. Content for <i>City Weekly</i> is sent by computer to the press in <a href="Ogden,_Utah" title="Ogden, Utah">Ogden</a>, and bundles of printed papers are trucked back south into Salt Lake City. The paper also began posting all content online in 1996, originally using the URL www.avenews.com. <i>City Weekly</i> is currently available at <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cityweekly.net">www.cityweekly.net</a> and starting in 2005 began posting additional information on a sister-commerce site, <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cwlistings.com">cwlistings.com</a></p>
<p>In the early 1990s the paper began giving out yearly awards that were chosen by readers. The categories and pages devoted to the "Best of Utah" issues expanded over time, and these issues are typically the largest published all year. Many establishments proudly display <i>City Weekly</i> "Best of..." awards, and often have several years' worth mounted above the cash register.</p>
<p>In 1996 the paper began recognizing local music in the "SLAMMY awards" (Salt Lake Area Music &amp; More). As with the "Best of Utah" issues, locals are encouraged to vote for their favorite local bands and <a href="Album" title="Album">albums</a> in different categories. The paper also hosts a party featuring several of the winners.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Salt_Lake_City_Weekly&action=edit&section=3.php.html" title="Edit section: Salt Lake City Weekly">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Salt_Lake_City_Weekly"><i>Salt Lake City Weekly</i></span></h3>
<p>In 1997 the growing paper changed its name to <i>Salt Lake City Weekly</i>. This name is abbreviated to <i>City Weekly</i> on the paper's masthead. Many people misunderstood the paper's original name, assuming that the <i>Private Eye</i> was a <a href="Private_investigator" title="Private investigator">detective agency</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The paper published stories of the <a href="2002_Winter_Olympics" title="2002 Winter Olympics">2002 Winter Olympics</a> <a href="2002_Winter_Olympic_bid_scandal" title="2002 Winter Olympic bid scandal">bribery scandal</a>. Discoveries that <a href="International_Olympic_Committee" title="International Olympic Committee">International Olympic Committee</a> members apparently accepted gifts in return for votes to select Salt Lake City as the Olympic host erupted into an internationally significant story in 1999 and 2000.</p>
<p>During the late 1990s, a suit to allow club and liquor advertising began making its way through local courts. <i>City Weekly</i> had tried and failed to persuade the state's Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control to lift Utah's peculiar restrictions on liquor advertising. National media like <i><a href="Wall_Street_Journal" title="Wall Street Journal" class="mw-redirect">The Wall Street Journal</a></i> and <i><a href="USA_Today" title="USA Today">USA Today</a></i> were published without constraints on their advertising.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> The case dragged on for years in <a href="../U.S._District_Court_for_the_District_of_Utah" title="U.S. District Court for the District of Utah" class="mw-redirect">Utah District Court</a> before Judge David Sam, who rejected the claim that advertising liquor in Utah was bound by national precedent.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> The <a href="United_States_Court_of_Appeals_for_the_Tenth_Circuit" title="United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit">10th Circuit Court of Appeals</a> overturned this ruling on July 24, 2001 when the court remanded plaintiff's request for appeal on the district court's ruling to deny preliminary <a href="Injunction" title="Injunction">injunction</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The Tenth Circuit stated that the plaintiffs satisfied requirements for an injunction, forcing the state to allow liquor advertising. In August, the Utah Alcoholic Beverage Control Commission began drafting amendments to legalize liquor advertising in print, in restaurants, and on billboards. <a href="The_Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter-day_Saints" title="The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a> (LDS Church) thought that the Commission's proposed changes went too far and urged retention of the old rules.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup> John Saltas chided the LDS Church in an editorial, but offered them a free full-page ad so they could explain their position against liquor advertising. The Church had not previously advertised in the paper, which was often considered <a href="Anti-Mormon" title="Anti-Mormon" class="mw-redirect">anti-Mormon</a>, but they took Saltas up on his offer. On November 29, 2001 <i>City Weekly</i> published the LDS statement. In the same issue, <i>City Weekly</i> featured its first liquor ad, for <a href="Jim_Beam" title="Jim Beam">Jim Beam</a>. Saltas told the <i>Tribune</i> that the timing was "just an ironic coincidence."<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In October 2002, editor Christopher Smart left <i>City Weekly</i> for a higher-paying news position with <i><a href="The_Salt_Lake_Tribune" title="The Salt Lake Tribune">The Salt Lake Tribune</a></i>. Saltas named John Yewell as editor; Yewell was let go after nine months. The paper's editorship was turned temporarily over to Ben Fulton, a long-time associate editor at the paper. Later Saltas announced that Fulton's editorship would be permanent. During his many years at the paper, up to his leave as editor in April 2007, Fulton garnered many editorial awards, including a Hearst Award for long-form journalism, as well as several first-place awards from the Utah Chapter Society of Professional Journalists and the Utah Press Association.</p>
<p>As the paper gained popularity and staff, the load on John Saltas decreased. In 2003 he stepped aside as publisher, naming Jim Rizzi as his successor. Rizzi, with over 20 years of alternative weekly experience, was groomed for the position. Saltas had hired him as a vice president in 2002. After being uninvolved with the paper's operations for several months, Rizzi asked Saltas to contribute a weekly column. Saltas now writes a light-hearted, somewhat <a href="Blog" title="Blog">blog</a>-like column called "Private Eye" where he talks aimlessly about his favorite <a href="Utah_Jazz" title="Utah Jazz">Utah Jazz</a> players (especially <a href="Carlos_Arroyo" title="Carlos Arroyo">Carlos Arroyo</a>), his <a href="Greeks" title="Greeks">Greek</a> heritage, and jokes that he's soon going to be fired.</p>
<p>In April 2007 Holly Mullen was announced as the paper's new editor. She had been an area journalist for nine years, most recently (until January 2007) as a columnist for <i>The Salt Lake Tribune.</i> In addition to her renown as a leftist reporter and writer, she is now noted as the wife of former Salt Lake City Mayor <a href="Ted_Wilson_(mayor)" title="Ted Wilson (mayor)">Ted Wilson</a>. On February 26, 2009, Mullen informed her friends through her Facebook profile that she had parted ways with the paper. At the same time, long-time City Weekly Managing Editor, Jerre Wroble was promoted to the Editor position.</p>
<p><i>Salt Lake City Weekly</i> is currently available at over 2000 locations, including sites outside the Salt Lake Valley (such as the Tooele Valley). The paper is found online at www.cityweekly.net. The 60,000 weekly Circulation for City Weekly is independently audited by Verified Audit and has been so for nearly 20 years.</p>
<p>In 2009, the Utah SPJ awarded Salt Lake City Weekly 13 journalism awards.</p>
<p>Stephen Dark, a senior staff-writer won Best Newspaper Reporter. The judges wrote, "by far Dark had the most diverse and interesting subject matter. His ability to tell a story in a clean and compelling manner also stood out." Dark won in the Military Reporting category for "Diary of a Suicide" and in Religion/Values Reporting for "Swap Meet."</p>
<p>Scott Renshaw, the Arts and Entertainment Editor received 2nd place in Review/Criticism for the article, "Romancing the Stoned" and 2nd place for Headline Writing.</p>
<p>Eric S. Peterson received 2nd in Criminal Justice Reporting for the article, "Hard Labor" and 1st place in Consumer Reporting for the article, "Jacked" the judges wrote, "Peterson did an excellent job of raising questions about the necessity for steep state tax breaks for oil companies at a time when they were earning record profits. He attempted to independently calculate the cost to taxpayers, who he pointed out are paying more at the pump in Utah than residents of other states without such a big industry presence. He was also fair, offering significant commentary from oil executives who way they need breaks to counter the costly process of production. With both sides, Peterson facilitated an intellectual debate with no easy answers." Peterson won 1st place in the Government Reporting category for the article, "Drug Deal." The judges wrote "Peterson offers a comprehensive analysis of a no-bid contract and the influences that contributed to the deal-making process. Reporter went above and beyond his call of duty by investigating business incorporation records, raising questions about the validity of the company awarded work and the state's attending to detail. Looks ripe for a follow-up." Peterson received 3rd place in Minority Issues Reporting for "Afraid to Talk."</p>
<p>Ted McDonough won 3rd place for Consumer Reporting for the article "Renting Sucks!" he won 3rd Place in Medical/Science Reporting for "Dust Up" and placed 3rd in the Personality Profile category for "Final Shot."</p>

<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Salt_Lake_City_Weekly&action=edit&section=6.php.html" title="Edit section: City Weekly and politics">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="City_Weekly_and_politics"><i>City Weekly</i> and politics</span></h2>
<p>In its origin as a publication promoting Salt Lake City-area nightlife during a time when state alcohol regulations were more strict, <i>City Weekly</i> developed a reputation for its tendency to challenge established viewpoints—a reputation which now extends to the paper's coverage of local politics.</p>
<p>Apart from covering scandals about former <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democratic</a> Salt Lake City Mayor <a href="Deedee_Corradini" title="Deedee Corradini">Deedee Corradini</a>, the paper controversially editorialized against her and her associates. The paper often listed her actions as "misses" in the "Hits &amp; Misses" column on the opinion page.</p>
<p><i>City Weekly</i> attacks on <a href="District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> Neal Gunnarson so upset him that he stole hundreds of copies of the paper from the racks in 1997. Technically, this is theft because only the <i>first copy</i> of publication is free; additional copies are one dollar each. An article appearing in the issue posited that Gunnarson was being too soft on Mayor Corradini, claiming that his weak prosecution didn't "pass the smell test."</p>
<p>During the 1999 mayoral elections, the scandal-ridden Corradini declined to seek re-election. <i>City Weekly</i> endorsed <a href="Rocky_Anderson" title="Rocky Anderson">Rocky Anderson</a> in a crowded primary. Anderson was an attorney who was once retained by the paper. Facing <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://votereid.com/stuart-reid/">Stuart Reid</a>, a member of Corradini's administration, Anderson won, but the paper remained neutral during his 2003 re-election. However, during Anderson's second term, he was visiting another city and crossed a police picket line in order to attend a scheduled meeting. He later remarked to a reporter that the line was not a picket line, but a demonstration, so there was no harm in crossing. This did not sit well with John Saltas, who viewed it as a repudiation of a useful labor negotiating tactic, and since that time Saltas has made several critical comments toward the Mayor in his columns.</p>
<p>In 2004, <i>City Weekly</i> published a series of articles criticizing embattled <a href="Salt_Lake_County,_Utah" title="Salt Lake County, Utah">Salt Lake County</a> mayor <a href="Nancy_Workman" title="Nancy Workman">Nancy Workman</a>. Workman was acquitted of criminal charges for misuse of County funds, but was forced out as a candidate by vote of the Salt Lake County Republican Party Central Committee. The Central Committee then proceeded to nominate and accept by acclamation candidate and developer Ellis Ivory. In the ensuing election last minute replacement Ellis Ivory, was defeated by <a href="Democratic_Party_(United_States)" title="Democratic Party (United States)">Democrat</a> <a href="Peter_Corroon" title="Peter Corroon">Peter Corroon</a>.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Salt_Lake_City_Weekly&action=edit&section=7.php.html" title="Edit section: Relationships to other Salt Lake papers">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Relationships_to_other_Salt_Lake_papers">Relationships to other Salt Lake papers</span></h2>
<p><i>City Weekly</i> comments extensively on local media through a "media beat" column and letters from the editor. In 2006 the major newspapers (through their joint publishing arm, MediaOne, formerly the Newspaper Agency Corporation) launched <i>In Utah This Week</i>, a free weekly events-oriented newspaper. Throughout the alternative newspaper industry, such publications produced by a city daily are referred to as Fake Alts, or FauxAlts.</p>
<p>Of the two daily papers in Salt Lake City, <i><a href="The_Salt_Lake_Tribune" title="The Salt Lake Tribune">The Salt Lake Tribune</a></i> and the <i><a href="Deseret_News" title="Deseret News">Deseret News</a></i>, <i>City Weekly</i> surprisingly<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> values<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> the LDS Church-owned <i>Deseret News</i> for its investigative reporting in spite of its conservative<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from March 2009">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> editorial page.</p>
<p>Saltas has mocked the <i>Tribune</i>'s byline "Utah's Independent Voice" by calling the paper "Utah's co-dependent voice." The paper, he points out, is published with the same MediaOne facilities as the two paper's <a href="Joint_operating_agreement" title="Joint operating agreement" class="mw-redirect">joint operating agreement</a>. Thus <i>City Weekly</i> casts the paper as being "less independent than it pretends to be."</p>
<p>The 2002 <i>Tribune</i> acquisition by <a href="Dean_Singleton" title="Dean Singleton" class="mw-redirect">Dean Singleton</a>, owner of the nation's 7th largest newspaper chain, prompted an <a href="Expos%C3%A9_(journalism)" title="Exposé (journalism)" class="mw-redirect">exposé</a>. <i>City Weekly</i> asserted that increased cooperation and expansion of the two daily papers under Singleton's <i>Tribune</i> leadership hurt surrounding papers' viability. The Tribune has hired two former reporters of the City Weekly, while City Weekly has hired several former Tribune reporters over the same time span, with moves in both directions affirming the legitimacy of news reporting in City Weekly.</p>
