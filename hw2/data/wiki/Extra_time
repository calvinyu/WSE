<p><b>Overtime</b> or <b>extra time</b> is an additional period of play specified under the rules of a sport to bring a game to a decision and avoid declaring the match a <a href="Tie_(draw)" title="Tie (draw)">tie</a> or draw. In most sports, this extra period is only played if the game is required to have a clear winner, as in <a href="Single-elimination_tournament" title="Single-elimination tournament">single-elimination tournaments</a> where only one team or player per match can advance to the next round. In other sports, particularly those prominently played in <a href="North_America" title="North America">North America</a> where ties are generally disfavored, some form of overtime is employed for all games.</p>
<p>The rules of overtime or extra time vary between sports and even different competitions. Some may employ "<a href="Sudden_death_(sport)" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a>", where the first player or team who scores immediately wins the game. In others, play continues until a specified time has elapsed, and only then is the winner declared. If the contest remains tied after the extra session, depending on the rules, the match may immediately end as a draw, additional periods may be played, or a different tiebreaking procedure such as a <a href="Penalty_shootout" title="Penalty shootout">penalty shootout</a> may be used instead.</p>
<p>The term "overtime" is primarily used in North America, whereas "extra time" is used in other continents.</p>

<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Overtime_(sports)&action=edit&section=2.php.html" title="Edit section: Knock-out contests (including professional competition)">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Knock-out_contests_.28including_professional_competition.29">Knock-out contests (including professional competition)</span></h3>
<p>In <a href="Association_football" title="Association football">football (soccer)</a> <a href="Single-elimination_tournament" title="Single-elimination tournament">knock-out</a> competitions or competition stages, teams play an additional 30 minutes extra time where the deciding leg (or replay of a tie) has not produced a winner by the end of regulation or full-time. Extra time is governed by the rules of the tournament, rather than the laws of the game. It follows a short break where players remain on or around the field of play and comprises two 15-minute periods, with teams changing ends in between. In a one-off tie or deciding replay, level scores nearly always go to extra time. Over two legs, teams only play extra time in the second leg where the aggregate score – then normally followed by an <a href="Away_goals_rule" title="Away goals rule">away goals rule</a> – has not produced a winner first. The score in games or ties resorting to extra time are often recorded with the abbreviation a.e.t. (after extra time), usually accompanying the earlier score after regulation time.</p>
<p>Not all knock-out competitions always employ extra time. For example, ties in many competitions are played over two legs (such as the <a href="UEFA_Champions_League" title="UEFA Champions League">UEFA Champions League</a> or <a href="FIFA_World_Cup_qualification" title="FIFA World Cup qualification">World Cup qualification intercontinental play-offs</a>), one at each competing team's 'home' stadium. Extra time in such competitions is only played at the end of the second leg should the tie still be undecided. Meanwhile ties in the English <a href="FA_Cup" title="FA Cup">FA Cup</a> used to be decided by as many replays as necessary until one produces a winner within normal time, rather than have any extra time (and/or shootout). Nowadays replays are limited to just the one, however, with the second going to extra time if teams are still level. Equally, <a href="CONMEBOL" title="CONMEBOL">CONMEBOL</a> has historically never used extra time in any of the competitions it directly organises, such as the <a href="Copa_Libertadores" title="Copa Libertadores">Copa Libertadores</a> (today, it uses extra time only in the final match of a competition).</p>
<p>Ties that are still without a winner after extra time are usually decided by kicks from the penalty spot, commonly called a <a href="Penalty_shootout_(football)" title="Penalty shootout (football)" class="mw-redirect">penalty shootout</a>. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many international matches tried to reduce this by employing the <a href="Golden_goal" title="Golden goal">golden goal</a> (also called "<a href="Sudden_death_(sport)" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a>") or silver goal rules (the game ending if a team has the lead after the first 15-minute period of extra time), but competitions have not retained these.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Overtime_(sports)&action=edit&section=3.php.html" title="Edit section: US High school rules">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="US_High_school_rules">US High school rules</span></h3>
<p>High school rules vary depending on the state and conference, but most will have a sudden-death overtime procedure wherein the game ends upon scoring a golden goal, although in some instances the overtime will go until completion with the team in the lead after time expires (i.e., silver goal rules) declared the winner. The overtime period length may vary, but it is commonly 10 minutes long. Depending on the state, if the game is still tied at the end of the first overtime:</p>
<ul>
<li>As many additional overtime periods –&#160;golden or silver goal rules – may be played as needed to determine a winner.</li>
<li>After one or more overtime periods result in the score remaining tied, a <a href="Penalty_shoot-out_(association_football)" title="Penalty shoot-out (association football)">shootout procedure</a> may be played. In a shootout, the coaches and/or team captains select five players to shoot penalty kicks, with teams alternating kicks from the penalty mark in an attempt to put the ball into the net. The procedure continues until each team has taken five kicks, or if one side has scored more successful kicks than the other could possibly reach with its remaining kicks.</li>
<li>If both teams make the same number of successful penalty kicks after all eligible players have taken their first kick, the procedure repeats; the teams are not required to follow the same order of kickers as was used for the first kick, and may replace one or more of the original kickers. The procedure repeats until one side has successfully converted more penalty kicks in a set of five attempts.</li>
<li>Depending on the state or conference, the game may go directly to a penalty shoot-out, rather than playing overtime.</li>

<p>The <a href="National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> introduced overtime for any divisional tiebreak games beginning in <a href="1940_NFL_season" title="1940 NFL season">1940</a>, and for championship games beginning in <a href="1946_NFL_season" title="1946 NFL season">1946</a>. The first postseason game to be played under these rules was the <a href="1958_NFL_Championship_Game" title="1958 NFL Championship Game">1958 NFL Championship Game</a> between the Baltimore Colts and New York Giants (the so-called "Greatest Game Ever Played"). In 1974, the NFL adopted sudden death overtime for regular season games. If the score is tied after regulation time has concluded, an additional 15-minute period is played. The captains meet with the officials for a coin toss, and then one side kicks off to the other, as at the start of a game. Under the original regular season format used through 2011, the first team to score during the extra period won the game. Additionally, during regular season games, fourth quarter timing rules were in effect throughout the period. This included a <a href="Two_minute_warning" title="Two minute warning" class="mw-redirect">two minute warning</a> if necessary. In the regular season, if the overtime period was completed without either side scoring, the game ended in a tie. Because there cannot be a tie in the <a href="Playoff" title="Playoff" class="mw-redirect">playoffs</a>, the teams would switch ends of the field and start multiple 15-minute overtime periods until one side scored. Additionally, all clock rules were as if a new game had started. Therefore, if a game was still tied with two minutes to go in double overtime, there would be a two minute warning (but not during the first overtime period as in the regular season). If it were still tied at the end of double overtime, the team that received the kickoff to start overtime would kick off to begin triple overtime.<sup id="cite_ref-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> Presumably, there would be a second coin flip to begin quintuple overtime, but this is unconfirmed and highly unlikely to ever happen. The longest NFL game played to date is 82 minutes, 40 seconds (and the Chiefs' last-ever game at Municipal Stadium), Miami kicker Garo Yepremian kicked the winning 37-yard field goal after 7:40 of double-overtime in the <a href="1971%E2%80%9372_NFL_playoffs" title="1971–72 NFL playoffs">1971–72 NFL playoffs</a> on <a href="Christmas_Day" title="Christmas Day" class="mw-redirect">Christmas Day</a> 1971. The longest in all of modern professional football is a 1984 <a href="United_States_Football_League" title="United States Football League">United States Football League</a> playoff game, also using the true sudden death rule, in which the <a href="Los_Angeles_Express" title="Los Angeles Express">Los Angeles Express</a> defeated the <a href="Michigan_Panthers" title="Michigan Panthers">Michigan Panthers</a> 27–21 in triple overtime.</p>
<p>As a consequence of the 1974 rule changes, the number of tie games dropped dramatically. Only 18 NFL games have ended in a tie since then, and just five since 1990. The most recent was on November 11, 2012 when the <a href="../St._Louis_Rams" title="St. Louis Rams">St. Louis Rams</a> tied with the <a href="San_Francisco_49ers" title="San Francisco 49ers">San Francisco 49ers</a> 24-24.</p>
<p>Scoreless ties were common in the early years of the NFL, but none has happened since 1943.</p>
<p>In March 2010, the <a href="National_Football_League" title="National Football League">NFL</a> amended its rules for postseason overtime after a vote by the team owners, with the rule being extended into the regular season in March 2012. If the team that receives the kickoff scores a touchdown; or if the defence scores a safety on its first possession, it is declared the winner. If it scores a field goal on its first possession, however, it then kicks off to the opposing team with an opportunity to score; if the score is tied again after that possession, true sudden death rules apply and the next team to score by any method is declared the winner. If both teams are still tied after the OT there will be another overtime period played, and that procedure is repeated until a winner is declared, unless it's a regular season game, which would simply end in a tie. There were no overtime games in the 2010 posteason, so the first implication of this rule came in the wild-card round in <a href="2011_NFL_playoffs" title="2011 NFL playoffs" class="mw-redirect">2011</a>. Incidentally, this was also the shortest overtime in NFL history. <a href="Pittsburgh_Steelers" title="Pittsburgh Steelers">Pittsburgh Steelers</a> kicker <a href="Shaun_Suisham" title="Shaun Suisham">Shaun Suisham</a> kicked off and the ball went out of the back of the end zone, resulting in a touchback and no time off the clock. <a href="Tim_Tebow" title="Tim Tebow">Tim Tebow</a>, then with the <a href="Denver_Broncos" title="Denver Broncos">Denver Broncos</a>, threw an 80-yard touchdown pass on the first play to <a href="Demaryius_Thomas" title="Demaryius Thomas">Demaryius Thomas</a> to give the Broncos the win in only 11 seconds.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The <a href="Arena_Football_League" title="Arena Football League">Arena Football League</a> and <a href="NFL_Europa" title="NFL Europa" class="mw-redirect">NFL Europa</a> used a variant in which each team is guaranteed one possession. Whoever is leading after one possession wins the game; if the teams remain tied after one possession, the game goes to sudden death. This procedure was used by the <a href="United_Football_League_(2009)" title="United Football League (2009)" class="mw-redirect">United Football League</a> in its inaugural 2009 season.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In <a href="College_football" title="College football">college</a> (beginning with the <a href="1996_college_football_season" title="1996 college football season" class="mw-redirect">1996 season</a>) and <a href="High_school_football" title="High school football">high school football</a>, as well as the <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="Canadian Football League">Canadian Football League</a>, an <i>overtime procedure</i> is used to determine the winner. This method is sometimes referred to as a "Kansas Playoff," or "Kansas Plan" because of its origins for <a href="Kansas_State_High_School_Activities_Association" title="Kansas State High School Activities Association">high school football in that state</a>. A brief summary of the rules:</p>
<ul>
<li>A coin toss determines which side shall attempt to score first, and at which end zone the scores shall be attempted.</li>
<li>Each team in turn will receive one possession (similar to <a href="Innings" title="Innings">innings</a> in <a href="Baseball" title="Baseball">baseball</a>), starting with first-and-10 from a fixed point on the opponent's side of the field:
<ul>
<li>In college football, the possession begins at the opponent's 25-yard line.</li>
<li>In high school football, the ball begins at the 10-yard line, with the option for state high school associations to use different yardage (such as the 15, 20, or 25-yard line)</li>
<li>In the CFL, where a <a href="Single_(football)" title="Single (football)">single point</a> can be scored on a punt, the 35-yard line is used.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The game clock does not run during overtime; the play clock, however, is enforced.</li>
<li>A team's possession ends when it scores (touchdown or field goal), misses a field goal, or turns over the ball (either on downs or by the defense otherwise gaining possession). As usual, a <a href="Touchdown" title="Touchdown">touchdown</a> by the offense is followed by a try for one or two points. In <a href="College_football" title="College football">NCAA football</a>, starting in triple overtime, teams <i>must</i> attempt a <a href="Two-point_conversion" title="Two-point conversion">two-point conversion</a> after a touchdown. Since 2010, <a href="Canadian_Football_League" title="Canadian Football League">CFL</a> teams must also attempt the two-point conversion after any touchdown in overtime.</li>
<li>In <a href="College_football" title="College football">college football</a> the defense may score a touchdown on a play on which it gains possession by turnover; such a play will satisfy the condition of each team having a possession and will therefore end the game. In <a href="High_school_football" title="High school football">high school football</a>, the defense is generally not allowed to score if it gains possession, although the <a href="Oregon_School_Activities_Association" title="Oregon School Activities Association">Oregon School Activities Association</a> adopted the college rule experimentally in 2005, and the <a href="University_Interscholastic_League" title="University Interscholastic League">University Interscholastic League</a> of <a href="Texas" title="Texas">Texas</a>, the <a href="Texas_Association_of_Private_and_Parochial_Schools" title="Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools">Texas Association of Private and Parochial Schools</a>, and the <a href="Massachusetts_Interscholastic_Athletic_Association" title="Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association">Massachusetts Interscholastic Athletic Association</a> use NCAA football rules. If scoring is not allowed or the turnover play does not end with a score, regardless of the eventual position of the ball at the end of the play, the team assumes offense and will begin their procedure from the specified position on the field.</li>
<li>Each team receives one charged time-out per overtime procedure (except in the CFL).</li>
<li>If the score remains tied at the end of the overtime procedure, an additional overtime procedure is played. The team with the second possession in one overtime procedure will have the first possession in the next overtime procedure.</li>
<li>In the CFL there is a limit of two overtime procedures in regular-season games (after which the game is a tie), but no limit in playoff games. In American college and high school football, the overtime procedures are continued until a winner is determined.</li>
</ul>
<p>On two occasions, just two plays were required to determine an overtime winner in an NCAA football game. These occurred on September 26, 2002, when <a href="Louisville_Cardinals_football" title="Louisville Cardinals football">Louisville</a> defeated <a href="Florida_State_Seminoles_football" title="Florida State Seminoles football">Florida State</a> 26–20, and September 27, 2003 when <a href="Georgia_Tech_Yellow_Jackets_football" title="Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football">Georgia Tech</a> defeated <a href="Vanderbilt_Commodores_football" title="Vanderbilt Commodores football">Vanderbilt</a> 24–17.</p>
<p>It is possible for a college game to end after a single play in overtime if the team on defense secures a turnover and returns it for a touchdown. (One example of a defensive touchdown ending the game occurred on September 9, 2005 when <a href="Ohio_Bobcats_football" title="Ohio Bobcats football">Ohio</a> defeated <a href="Pittsburgh_Panthers_football" title="Pittsburgh Panthers football">Pittsburgh</a> 16–10 on an 85 yard interception return by <a href="Dion_Byrum" title="Dion Byrum">Dion Byrum</a>; this occurred on the third play of overtime.) Furthermore, it is possible (but not likely) that the defense may get a safety on the first possession in overtime, thus ending the game after only one overtime play. Because this would require the offense to go backward 75 yards, this is extremely improbable and has never happened in FBS.</p>
<p>As of 2011, the <a href="Missouri_Tigers_football" title="Missouri Tigers football">Missouri Tigers</a> have competed in the most overtime college football games, totalling 14.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>An alternate overtime method to the Kansas Playoffs occasionally used at the high school level is the <a href="California_playoff" title="California playoff">California playoff</a>.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Overtime_(sports)&action=edit&section=7.php.html" title="Edit section: XFL">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="XFL">XFL</span></h3>
<p>The short-lived <a href="XFL" title="XFL">XFL</a> used a modified Kansas Playoff, where the series would start on the 20-yard line and have four downs to score. However, if the first team to play overtime scored a touchdown in less than four downs, the second team would have to score in just as many plays (for instance, if the first team scored a touchdown on three downs, the second team would only have three downs to score a touchdown). Neither team could kick a field goal until the fourth down. Although such a scenario never happened in the league's short life, the XFL rules did not explain what would happen should a turnover occur and the set of four downs end prematurely. Rather than a coin toss, the winner of the opening scramble at the beginning of the game also got to choose to go first or second in overtime.</p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Overtime_(sports)&action=edit&section=8.php.html" title="Edit section: Basketball">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Basketball">Basketball</span></h2>
<p>In <a href="Basketball" title="Basketball">basketball</a>, if the score is tied at the end of regulation play, the teams play multiple five-minute overtime periods. In levels below collegiate/Olympic play, an overtime period is half the length of a standard quarter, i.e., four minutes for high school varsity. <a href="3x3_(basketball)" title="3x3 (basketball)">3x3</a> (originally FIBA 33), a formalized version of the halfcourt three-on-three game, uses an untimed overtime (the former FIBA 33 rules called for two-minute periods).

The <a href="National_Basketball_Association" title="National Basketball Association">National Basketball Association</a> and the <a href="WNBA" title="WNBA" class="mw-redirect">WNBA</a>, which uses a quarter-possession rule to start periods after the opening jump, also uses a jump ball.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup><sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The entire overtime period is played; there is no sudden-death provision. The only exception is in 3x3, in which the game ends once either team has scored 2&#160;points in overtime, with baskets made from behind the three-point arc worth 2&#160;points and all other successful shots worth 1&#160;point. All counts of personal fouls against players are carried over for the purpose of disqualifying players. If the score remains tied after an overtime period, an additional overtime period is played.</p>
<p>As many as six overtime periods have been necessary to determine a winner in a NBA game.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In exhibition games (non-competitive play), it is upon the discretion of the coaches and/or organizers if an overtime is to be played, especially if it is a non-tournament game (a one-off event).</p>
<p>Starting in the 2009–10 season, <a href="ULEB" title="ULEB">ULEB</a>, the organizer of the <a href="Euroleague_Basketball" title="Euroleague Basketball">Euroleague</a> and <a href="Eurocup_Basketball" title="Eurocup Basketball">Eurocup</a>, introduced a new rule for two-legged ties that eliminated overtime unless necessary to break a tie on aggregate. The rule was first used in the <a href="ULEB_Eurocup_2009%E2%80%9310" title="ULEB Eurocup 2009–10" class="mw-redirect">2009–10 Eurocup</a> quarterfinals (which consist of two-legged ties), although no game in that phase of the competition ended in a regulation draw.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> ULEB extended this rule to all two-legged ties in its competitions, including the Euroleague, in <a href="2010%E2%80%9311_Euroleague_Basketball" title="2010–11 Euroleague Basketball" class="mw-redirect">2010–11</a>. One game in the <a href="Euroleague_2010%E2%80%9311_qualifying_rounds" title="Euroleague 2010–11 qualifying rounds">qualifying rounds</a> of that season (the only phase of the Euroleague that uses two-legged ties), specifically the second leg of the third qualifying round tie between <a href="Spirou_Charleroi" title="Spirou Charleroi">Spirou Charleroi</a> and <a href="ALBA_Berlin" title="ALBA Berlin" class="mw-redirect">ALBA Berlin</a>, ended in a draw after regulation. No overtime was played in that game because Spirou had won the first leg. Although other competitions use two-legged ties at various stages, the ULEB competitions are the only ones known to use overtime only if the aggregate score after the second game is tied.</p>

<p>Ties are common in <a href="Ice_hockey" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a> due to the game's low-scoring nature. If the score is tied at the end of regulation play, certain leagues play overtime.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="National_Hockey_League" title="National Hockey League">NHL</a> (regular season): If a game is tied after regulation time (three 20-minute periods), the teams play in a <a href="Sudden_death_(sport)#Ice_hockey" title="Sudden death (sport)">sudden death</a> five-minute overtime period, with a goaltender and four skaters per side (as opposed to the standard five).<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup> If nobody scores in the overtime period, the teams engage in a "<a href="Penalty_shootout" title="Penalty shootout">penalty shootout</a>" where 3 skaters, selected by the head coaches on the teams, go one-on-one against the opposing goaltender, taking the puck at center ice for a "penalty shot."<sup id="cite_ref-nhlrules_12-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlrules-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> If the shootout remains tied after the initial 3 rounds, the shootout continues in a sudden-death fashion; no player may participate in a shootout twice unless the entire active roster has been exhausted, which so far has never happened.<sup id="cite_ref-nhlrules_12-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlrules-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup> The greatest number of shooters in a single shootout was 30 during a game between the <a href="New_York_Rangers" title="New York Rangers">New York Rangers</a> and <a href="Washington_Capitals" title="Washington Capitals">Washington Capitals</a>.

</ul>
<dl>
<dd>The 5-minute overtime period was introduced for regular season games beginning with the 1983–84 NHL season, but with teams at full strength on the ice.<sup id="cite_ref-nhlovertime_14-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlovertime-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> Overtime in the regular season was reduced to four skaters a side starting in the 2000–2001 season.<sup id="cite_ref-nhlovertime_14-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlovertime-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup> The "shootout" was introduced for the 2005–06 NHL regular season.<sup id="cite_ref-nhlovertime_14-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlovertime-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></dd>
</dl>
<ul>
<li>NHL (post-season)<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup>: Following an intermission, an additional full 20-minute period is played. Teams remain at full strength unless this is affected by penalties during the third period. A goal ends the game in sudden death; if neither team scores, another intermission is taken, followed by an additional overtime period. The teams change ends of the ice for each period. This has made for lengthy games in the history of the NHL playoffs, with some games going as far as five or six overtimes before the deciding goal is scored.<sup id="cite_ref-nhlotrecords_16-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-nhlotrecords-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup></li>
<li>NCAA (regular season): If a game is tied at the end of regulation, the teams play a sudden-death 5-minute overtime. Both teams play at full strength, unless affected by penalties. If neither team scores during overtime, the game ends in a tie.</li>
<li>NCAA (in-season tournaments): For tournaments held during the season (such as the <a href="Beanpot_(ice_hockey)" title="Beanpot (ice hockey)">Beanpot</a> and <a href="Great_Lakes_Invitational" title="Great Lakes Invitational">Great Lakes Invitational</a>), in which advancement or determination of a champion is necessary, organizers have the option of either using the post-season overtime procedure or using the regular-season procedure followed by a penalty shootout. Statistics from a shootout are not counted by the NCAA, and a game decided by a shootout is considered a tie for NCAA tournament selection purposes.</li>
<li>NCAA (post-season): Same as the NHL overtime procedure above, except that all overtimes are played with the teams defending the same ends as for the third period. Games decided in overtime are considered wins or losses rather than ties, regardless of how many overtimes are played.</li>
<li>International (round robin): As of the 2007 IIHF World Championships, the IIHF instituted the "three point rule", which not only awarded the winning team three points for a regulation win, but awarded them two points for a win in a 5 minute overtime period or a Game Winning Shot (shootout). Games in IIHF round robins can therefore no longer end in a tie. In the World Cup of Hockey in 2004, the NHL's tiebreaking procedure at the time was followed: there was a five-minute sudden death period at four skaters per side, and if the score remained tied after the overtime period, it stood as a tie. The game between Sweden and Finland ended in a 4–4 tie after 65 minutes.</li>
<li>International (medal rounds): Various tiebreaking procedures have been used for international tournaments, with all of them save one (World Cup of Hockey 2004) following a common theme: one period varying in length of sudden-death overtime followed by a shootout of five skaters per side (as opposed to the NHL's three skaters per side; it also differs in that if the shootout does not resolve the tie, the same five skaters then shoot again). The length of the overtime period has varied between 5, 10, and 20 minutes, and 5-on-5 and 4-on-4 formats have been used. The most recent format used was at the 2010 Olympics (particularly in the gold medal game); there were 20 minutes of 4-on-4 followed by a shootout. In 2006, it was 20 minutes of 5-on-5. All men's games ended in regulation during the medal rounds, while the women's semifinal between the United States and Sweden required a shootout to determine the winner. At the World Cup of Hockey in 2004, the NHL's postseason tiebreaking procedure was used (multiple 20-minute periods of 5-on-5 until a goal is scored). The only overtime game in the playoff round was the semifinal between the Czech Republic and Canada. Canada won 4–3 with a goal 2 minutes and 16 seconds into the first overtime period.</li>

<p><a href="Baseball" title="Baseball">Baseball</a> and <a href="Softball" title="Softball">softball</a> are unique among the popular North American team sports in that they do not use a game clock.

<p><a href="Major_League_Baseball" title="Major League Baseball">Major League Baseball</a> games normally only end in a tie if the match is called off due to weather conditions.
