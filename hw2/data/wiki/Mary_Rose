<p>The <i><b>Mary Rose</b></i> was a <a href="Carrack" title="Carrack">carrack</a>-type <a href="Warship" title="Warship">warship</a> of the English <a href="Tudor_navy" title="Tudor navy">Tudor navy</a> of <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">King Henry&#160;VIII</a>. After serving for 33 years in several wars against <a href="Early_modern_France" title="Early modern France">France</a>, <a href="Kingdom_of_Scotland" title="Kingdom of Scotland">Scotland</a>, and <a href="History_of_Brittany" title="History of Brittany">Brittany</a> and after being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she saw her last action on <span class="nowrap">19 July</span> 1545. While leading the attack on the <a href="Galley" title="Galley">galleys</a> of a French invasion fleet, she sank in the <a href="Solent" title="Solent">Solent</a>, the straits north of the <a href="Isle_of_Wight" title="Isle of Wight">Isle of Wight</a>. The wreck of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was rediscovered in 1971 and salvaged in 1982 by the <a href="Mary_Rose_Trust" title="Mary Rose Trust">Mary Rose Trust</a> in one of the most complex and expensive projects in the history of <a href="Maritime_archaeology" title="Maritime archaeology">maritime archaeology</a>. The surviving section of the ship and thousands of recovered artefacts are of immeasurable value as a <a href="Tudor_period" title="Tudor period">Tudor-era</a> <a href="Time_capsule" title="Time capsule">time capsule</a>.</p>
<p>The excavation and salvage of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was a milestone in the field of maritime archaeology, comparable in complexity and cost only to the raising of the Swedish 17th-century warship <i><a href="Vasa_(ship)" title="Vasa (ship)">Vasa</a></i> in 1961. The finds include weapons, sailing equipment, naval supplies and a wide array of objects used by the crew. Many of the artefacts are unique to the <i>Mary Rose</i> and have provided insights into topics ranging from <a href="Naval_warfare" title="Naval warfare">naval warfare</a> to the history of musical instruments. Since the mid-1980s, while undergoing conservation, the remains of the hull have been on display at the <a href="HMNB_Portsmouth" title="HMNB Portsmouth">Portsmouth Historic Dockyard</a>. An extensive collection of well-preserved artefacts is on display at the nearby <a href="Mary_Rose_Museum" title="Mary Rose Museum">Mary Rose Museum</a>.</p>
<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> had no known career as a merchant vessel. She was one of the largest ships in the English navy throughout more than three decades of intermittent war and was one of the earliest examples of a purpose-built sailing warship. She was armed with new types of heavy guns that could fire through the recently invented <a href="Gun-port" title="Gun-port" class="mw-redirect">gun-ports</a>. After being substantially rebuilt in 1536, she was also one of the earliest ships that could fire a <a href="Broadside" title="Broadside">broadside</a>, although the <a href="Line_of_battle" title="Line of battle">line of battle</a> tactics that employed it had not yet been developed. Several theories have sought to explain the demise of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, based on historical records, knowledge of 16th-century shipbuilding and modern experiments. However, the precise cause of her sinking is still unclear, because of conflicting testimonies and a lack of conclusive physical evidence.</p>

<p>By the late 15th century, England was a relatively insignificant state on the periphery of Europe. The great victories against <a href="Early_modern_France" title="Early modern France">France</a> in the <a href="Hundred_Years'_War" title="Hundred Years' War">Hundred Years' War</a> were in the past; only the small enclave of <a href="Calais" title="Calais">Calais</a> in northern France remained as a remnant of the vast continental holdings of the English kings.

The ambitious naval policies of <a href="Henry_V_of_England" title="Henry V of England">Henry&#160;V</a> were not matched by his successors, and from 1422 to 1509 only six ships were built for the crown.

<p>At the onset of the <a href="Early_modern_period" title="Early modern period">early modern period</a>, the great European powers were France, the <a href="Holy_Roman_Empire" title="Holy Roman Empire">Holy Roman Empire</a> and <a href="Habsburg_Spain" title="Habsburg Spain">Spain</a>. All three became involved in the <a href="War_of_the_League_of_Cambrai" title="War of the League of Cambrai">War of the League of Cambrai</a> in 1508. The conflict was initially aimed at the <a href="Republic_of_Venice" title="Republic of Venice">Republic of Venice</a> but eventually turned against France. Through the Spanish possessions in the <a href="Low_Countries" title="Low Countries">Low Countries</a>, England had close economic ties with the <a href="Habsburg_Spain" title="Habsburg Spain">Spanish Habsburgs</a>, and it was the young <a href="Henry_VIII_of_England" title="Henry VIII of England">Henry VIII's</a> ambition to repeat the glorious martial endeavours of his predecessors. In 1509, six weeks into his reign, Henry married the Spanish princess <a href="Catherine_of_Aragon" title="Catherine of Aragon">Catherine of Aragon</a> and joined the League, intent on certifying his historical claim as king of both England and France. By 1511 Henry was part of an anti-French alliance that also included <a href="Ferdinand_II_of_Aragon" title="Ferdinand II of Aragon">Ferdinand&#160;II of Aragon</a>, <a href="Pope_Julius_II" title="Pope Julius II">Pope Julius&#160;II</a> and Holy Roman emperor <a href="Maximilian_I,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor">Maximilian</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-2" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-2"><span>[</span>2<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The small navy that Henry VIII inherited from his father had only two sizeable ships, the <a href="Carrack" title="Carrack">carracks</a> <i>Regent</i> and <i>Sovereign</i>. Just months after his accession, two large ships were ordered: the <i>Mary Rose</i> and the <i><a href="Peter_Pomegranate" title="Peter Pomegranate">Peter Pomegranate</a></i> (later known as the <i>Peter</i> after being rebuilt in 1536) of about 500 and 450&#160;tons respectively. Which king ordered the building of the <i>Mary Rose</i> is unclear; although construction began during Henry VIII's reign, the plans for naval expansion could have been in the making earlier. Nevertheless, it was Henry&#160;VIII who oversaw the project and he who ordered additional large ships to be built, most notably the <i><a href="Henry_Grace_a_Dieu" title="Henry Grace a Dieu" class="mw-redirect">Henry Grace a Dieu</a></i> ("Henry Grace of God"), or <i>Great Harry</i> at more than 1000&#160;tons <a href="Burthen" title="Burthen" class="mw-redirect">burthen</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup> By the 1520s the English state had established a <i>de facto</i> permanent "Navy Royal", the organizational ancestor of the modern <a href="Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The vessels in the painting are shown decorated with wooden panels similar to those that would have been used on the <i>Mary Rose</i> on special occasions.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The construction of the <i>Mary Rose</i> began in 1510 in <a href="Portsmouth" title="Portsmouth">Portsmouth</a> and she was <a href="Ship_naming_and_launching" title="Ship naming and launching">launched</a> in July 1511. She was then towed to <a href="London" title="London">London</a> and fitted with <a href="Rigging" title="Rigging">rigging</a> and <a href="Deck_(ship)" title="Deck (ship)">decking</a>, and supplied with armaments. Other than the structural details needed to sail, stock and arm the <i>Mary Rose</i>, she was also equipped with flags, banners and <a href="Pennon" title="Pennon">streamers</a> (extremely elongated flags that were flown from the top of the masts) that were either painted or gilded.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Constructing a warship of the size of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was a major undertaking, requiring vast quantities of high quality material. In the case of building a state-of-the-art warship, these materials were primarily oak. The total amount of timber needed for the construction can only be roughly calculated since only about one third of the ship still exists.<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> One estimate for the number of trees is around 600 mostly large <a href="Oak" title="Oak">oaks</a>, representing about 16 hectares (40&#160;acres) of woodland. The huge trees that had been common in Europe and the British Isles in previous centuries were by the 16th century quite rare, which meant that timbers were brought in from all over southern England. The largest timbers used in the construction were of roughly the same size as those used in the roofs of the largest cathedrals in the <a href="High_Middle_Ages" title="High Middle Ages">high Middle Ages</a>. An unworked hull plank would have weighed over 300&#160;kg (660&#160;lb), and one of the main deck <a href="Beam_(structure)" title="Beam (structure)">beams</a> would have weighed close to three quarters of a tonne.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The common explanation for the ship's name was that it was inspired by Henry VIII's favourite sister, <a href="Mary_Tudor,_Queen_of_France" title="Mary Tudor, Queen of France">Mary Tudor</a>, and the rose as the emblem of the <a href="Tudor_dynasty" title="Tudor dynasty">Tudors</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-8" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> According to historians David Childs, <a href="David_Loades" title="David Loades">David Loades</a> and Peter Marsden, no direct evidence of naming the ship after the King's sister exists. It was far more common at the time to give ships pious Christian names, a long-standing tradition in Western Europe, or to associate them with their royal patrons. Names like <i>Grace Dieu</i> (<a href="Grace_of_God" title="Grace of God" class="mw-redirect">Grace of God</a>) and <i>Holighost</i> (<a href="Holy_Spirit" title="Holy Spirit">Holy Spirit</a>) had been common since the 15th century and other Tudor navy ships had names like the <i>Regent</i> and <i>Three Ostrich Feathers</i> (referring to the crest of the <a href="Prince_of_Wales" title="Prince of Wales">Prince of Wales</a>). The <a href="Virgin_Mary" title="Virgin Mary" class="mw-redirect">Virgin Mary</a> is a more likely candidate for a namesake, and she was also associated with the mystic rose. The name of the sister ship of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, the <i><a href="Peter_Pomegranate" title="Peter Pomegranate">Peter Pomegranate</a></i>, is believed to have been named in honour of <a href="Saint_Peter" title="Saint Peter">Saint Peter</a>, founder of the Christian church, and the badge of the Queen <a href="Catharine_of_Aragon" title="Catharine of Aragon" class="mw-redirect">Catharine of Aragon</a>, a <a href="Pomegranate" title="Pomegranate">pomegranate</a>. According to Childs, Loades and Marsden, the two ships, which were built around the same time, were named in honour of the king and queen respectively.<sup id="cite_ref-9" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-9"><span>[</span>9<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The <i>Mary Rose</i> as depicted in the <a href="Anthony_Roll" title="Anthony Roll">Anthony Roll</a>. The distinct <a href="Carrack" title="Carrack">carrack</a> profile with high "castles" fore and aft can clearly be seen. Although the number of guns and gun ports is not entirely accurate, the picture is overall an accurate illustration of the ship.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> was substantially rebuilt in 1536, and much of the discussion in this article relates to her as she appeared when excavated. The 1536 rebuilding turned a ship of 500 tons into one of 700 tons, and added an entire extra tier of broadside guns to the old <a href="Carrack" title="Carrack">carrack</a>-style structure. The description herein should thus not be too closely attributed to the ship as originally built in 1509.</p>
<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> was built according to the <a href="Carrack" title="Carrack">carrack</a>-style with high "castles" in the bow and stern with a low waist of open decking in the middle. The shape of the hull has a so-called <a href="Tumblehome" title="Tumblehome">tumblehome</a> form and reflected the use of ship as a platform for heavy guns. Above the waterline, the hull gradually narrows in order to compensate for the weight of the guns and to make boarding more difficult.<sup id="cite_ref-10" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-10"><span>[</span>10<span>]</span></a></sup> Since only part of the hull has survived, it is not possible to determine many of the basic dimensions with any great accuracy. The <a href="Moulded_breadth" title="Moulded breadth" class="mw-redirect">moulded breadth</a>, the widest point of the ship roughly above the waterline, was about 12 metres (39&#160;ft) and the keel about 32 metres (105&#160;ft), although the ship's overall length is highly uncertain.<sup id="cite_ref-11" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-11"><span>[</span>11<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The hull had four levels separated by three <a href="Deck_(ship)" title="Deck (ship)">decks</a>. The terminology for these in the 16th century was still not standardised so the terms used here are those that were applied by the <a href="Mary_Rose_Trust" title="Mary Rose Trust">Mary Rose Trust</a>. The <i><a href="Hold_(ship)" title="Hold (ship)">hold</a></i> lay furthest down in the ship, right above the bottom planking below the waterline. This is where the kitchen, or <a href="Galley_(kitchen)" title="Galley (kitchen)">galley</a>, was situated and the food was cooked. Directly aft of the galley was the mast step, a rebate in the centre-most timber of the <a href="Keelson" title="Keelson" class="mw-redirect">keelson</a>, right above the <a href="Keel" title="Keel">keel</a>, which supported the main mast, and next to it the main <a href="Bilge_pump" title="Bilge pump">bilge pump</a>. To increase the stability of the ship, the hold was where the <a href="Sailing_ballast" title="Sailing ballast">ballast</a> was placed and much of the supplies were kept. Right above the hold was the <i><a href="Orlop" title="Orlop">orlop</a></i>, the lowest deck. Like the hold it was partitioned and was also used as a storage area for everything from food to spare sails.<sup id="cite_ref-12" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-12"><span>[</span>12<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The remains of the <i>Mary Rose'</i>s hull. All deck levels can be made out clearly, including the minor remnants of the sterncastle deck.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Above the orlop lay the <i>main deck</i> which housed the heaviest guns. The side of the hull on the main deck level had seven gunports on each side fitted with heavy lids that would have been watertight when closed. This was also the highest deck that was caulked and waterproof. Along the sides of the main deck there were cabins under the forecastle and sterncastle which have been identified as belonging to the carpenter, <a href="Barber-surgeon" title="Barber-surgeon" class="mw-redirect">barber-surgeon</a>, pilot and possibly also the master gunner and some of the officers. The top deck in the hull structure was the <i>upper deck</i> (or <a href="Weather_deck" title="Weather deck" class="mw-redirect">weather deck</a>) which was exposed to the elements in the waist. It was a dedicated fighting deck without any known partitions and a mix of heavy and light guns. Over the open waist the upper deck was entirely covered with a coarse netting as a defence measure against boarding.<sup id="cite_ref-13" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-13"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup> Though very little of the upper deck has survived, it has been suggested that it housed the main living quarters of the crew underneath the sterncastle. A drainage located in this area has been identified as a possible "piss-dale", a general urinal to complement the regular toilets that would probably have been located in the bow.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>14<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The castles of the <i>Mary Rose</i> had additional decks, but since virtually nothing of them survives, their design has had to be reconstructed from historical records. Contemporary ships of equal size were consistently listed as having three decks in both castles. Although speculative, this layout is supported by the illustration in the Anthony Roll and the gun inventories.<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the early stages of excavation of the wreck, it was believed that the ship had originally been built with <a href="Clinker_(boat_building)" title="Clinker (boat building)">clinker</a> (or clench) planking, a technique where the hull consisted of overlapping planks that bore the structural strength of the ship. Cutting <a href="Gunport" title="Gunport" class="mw-redirect">gunports</a> into a clinker-built hull would have meant weakening the ship's structural integrity, and it was assumed that she was later rebuilt to accommodate a hull with <a href="Carvel_(boat_building)" title="Carvel (boat building)">carvel</a> edge-to-edge planking with a skeletal structure to support a hull perforated with gunports.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> Later examination indicates that the clinker planking is not present throughout the ship; only the outer structure of the sterncastle is built with overlapping planking, though not with a true clinker technique.<sup id="cite_ref-17" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-17"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Although only the lower fittings of the rigging survives, a 1514 inventory and the only known contemporary depiction of the ship from the <a href="Anthony_Roll" title="Anthony Roll">Anthony Roll</a> have been used to determine how the propulsion system of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was designed. Nine, or possibly ten, sails were flown from four masts and a bowsprit: the <a href="Foremast" title="Foremast" class="mw-redirect">foremast</a> and <a href="Mainmast" title="Mainmast" class="mw-redirect">mainmast</a> had two and three square sails respectively; the <a href="Mizzen" title="Mizzen" class="mw-redirect">mizzen</a> mast had a <a href="Lateen" title="Lateen">lateen</a> sail and a small square sail and the <a href="Bonaventure_mizzen" title="Bonaventure mizzen" class="mw-redirect">bonaventure mizzen</a> had at least one lateen sail, and possibly also a square sail, and the <a href="Bowsprit" title="Bowsprit">bowsprit</a> flew a small square <a href="Spritsail_(square-rigged)" title="Spritsail (square-rigged)">spritsail</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-18" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-18"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup> According to the <a href="Anthony_Roll" title="Anthony Roll">Anthony Roll</a> illustration (see top of this section), the <a href="Yard_(sailing)" title="Yard (sailing)">yards</a> (the <a href="Spar_(sailing)" title="Spar (sailing)">spars</a> from which the sails were set) on the foremast and mainmast were also equipped with sheerhooks, twin curved blades sharpened on the inside, that were intended to cut an enemy ship's rigging during boarding actions.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>19<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The sailing capabilities of the <i>Mary Rose</i> were commented on by her contemporaries and were once even put to the test. In March 1513 a contest was arranged off <a href="The_Downs" title="The Downs">The Downs</a>, west of <a href="Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, in which she raced against nine other ships.

The picture clearly shows how medieval naval tactics focused on close combat fighting and boarding.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> represented a transitional ship design in naval warfare. Since ancient times, war at sea had been fought much like that on land: with melee weapons and bows and arrows, but on floating wooden platforms rather than battlefields. Though the introduction of guns was a significant change, it only slowly changed the dynamics of ship-to-ship combat.<sup id="cite_ref-23" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-23"><span>[</span>23<span>]</span></a></sup> As guns became heavier and able to take more powerful gunpowder charges, they needed to be placed lower in the ship, closer to the water line. Gunports cut in the hull of ships had been introduced as early as 1501, only about a decade before the <i>Mary Rose</i> was built.<sup id="cite_ref-24" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-24"><span>[</span>24<span>]</span></a></sup> This made <a href="Broadside" title="Broadside">broadsides</a>,<sup id="cite_ref-25" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-25"><span>[</span>25<span>]</span></a></sup> coordinated volleys from all the guns on one side of a ship, possible for the first time in history, or at least in theory. Naval tactics throughout the 16th century and well into the 17th century focused on countering the oar-powered <a href="Galley" title="Galley">galleys</a> that were armed with heavy guns in the bow, facing forwards, which were aimed by turning the entire ship against its target. Combined with inefficient gunpowder and the difficulties inherent in firing accurately from moving platforms, this meant that boarding remained the primary tactic for decisive victory throughout the 16th century.<sup id="cite_ref-26" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-26"><span>[</span>26<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As the <i>Mary Rose</i> was built and served during a period of rapid development of heavy artillery, her armament was a mix of old designs and innovations. The heavy armament was a mix of older-type wrought iron and cast bronze guns, which differed considerably in size, range and design. The large iron guns were made up of staves or bars welded into cylinders and then reinforced by shrinking iron hoops and <a href="Breech_loader" title="Breech loader" class="mw-redirect">breech loaded</a>, from the back, and equipped with simpler <a href="Gun-carriage" title="Gun-carriage" class="mw-redirect">gun-carriages</a> made from hollowed-out elm logs with only one pair of wheels, or without wheels entirely. The bronze guns were cast in one piece and rested on four-wheel carriages which were essentially the same as those used until the 19th century. The breech-loaders were cheaper to produce and both easier and faster to reload, but could take less powerful charges than cast bronze guns. Generally, the bronze guns used cast iron shot and were more suited to penetrate hull sides while the iron guns used stone shot that would shatter on impact and leave large, jagged holes, but both could also fire a variety of ammunition intended to destroy rigging and light structure or injure enemy personnel.<sup id="cite_ref-27" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-27"><span>[</span>27<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The majority of the guns, however, were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the <i>bases</i>, <a href="Breech-loading_swivel_gun" title="Breech-loading swivel gun">breech-loading swivel guns</a>, most likely placed in the castles, and <i>hailshot pieces</i>, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions that were used to support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though the design is unknown, there were two <i>top pieces</i> in a <a href="Anthony_Roll" title="Anthony Roll">1546 inventory</a> (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in one or more of the fighting tops.<sup id="cite_ref-28" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-28"><span>[</span>28<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The ship went through several changes in her armament throughout her career, most significantly accompanying her "rebuilding" in 1536 (see below), when the number of anti-personnel guns was reduced and a second tier of carriage-mounted long guns fitted. There are three inventories that list her guns, dating to 1514, 1540 and 1546.<sup id="cite_ref-roll_30-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-roll-30"><span>[</span>30<span>]</span></a></sup> Together with records from the armoury at the <a href="Tower_of_London" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, these show how the configuration of guns changed as gun-making technology evolved and new classifications were invented. In 1514, the armament consisted mostly of anti-personnel guns like the larger breech-loading iron <i>murderers</i> and the small <i>serpentines</i>, <i>demi-slings</i> and stone guns. Only a handful of guns in the first inventory were powerful enough to hole enemy ships, and most would have been supported by the ship's structure rather than resting on carriages. The inventories of both the <i>Mary Rose</i> and the Tower had changed radically by 1540. There were now the new cast bronze <i>cannons</i>, <i>demi-cannons</i>, <i>culverins</i> and <i>sakers</i> and the wrought iron <i>port pieces</i> (a name that indicated they fired through ports), all of which required carriages, had longer range and were capable of doing serious damage to other ships. The analysis of the 1514 inventory combined with hints of structural changes in the ship both indicate that the gunports on the main deck were indeed a later addition.<sup id="cite_ref-31" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-31"><span>[</span>31<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The port pieces proved particularly efficient at smashing large holes in wood when firing stone shot and were a devastating anti-personnel weapon when loaded with flakes or pebbles.<sup id="cite_ref-34" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-34"><span>[</span>34<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

On the <i>Mary Rose</i>, the longbows could only have been drawn and shot properly from behind protective panels in the open waist or from the top of the castles as the lower decks lacked sufficient headroom. There were several types of bows of various size and range. Lighter bows would have been used as "sniper" bows, while the heavier design could possibly have been used to shoot fire arrows.<sup id="cite_ref-37" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-37"><span>[</span>37<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Throughout her 33-year career, the crew of the <i>Mary Rose</i> changed several times and varied considerably in size. It would have a minimal skeleton crew of 17 men or fewer in peace time and when she was "in ordinary" (in reserve).<sup id="cite_ref-39" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-39"><span>[</span>39<span>]</span></a></sup> The average wartime manning would have been about 185 soldiers, 200 sailors, 20–30 gunners and an assortment of other specialists such as surgeons, trumpeters and members of the admiral's staff for a total of 400–450 men. When taking part in land invasions or raids, such as in the summer of 1512, the number of soldiers could have swelled to just over 400 for a combined total of more than 700. Even with the normal crew size of around 400, the ship was quite crowded, and with additional soldiers would have been extremely cramped.<sup id="cite_ref-40" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-40"><span>[</span>40<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Very little is known of the identity of the men who served on the <i>Mary Rose</i>, even when it comes to the names of the officers, who would have belonged to the gentry.

<p>The bones of a total of 179 individuals were found during the excavations of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, including 92 "fairly complete skeletons", more or less complete collections of bones associated with specific individuals.<sup id="cite_ref-46" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-46"><span>[</span>46<span>]</span></a></sup> Analysis of these has shown that crew members were all male, most of them young adults. Some were no more than 11–13 years old, and the majority (81%) under 30. They were mainly of English origin and according to archaeologist Julie Gardiner they most likely came from the <a href="West_Country" title="West Country">West Country</a>, many following their aristocratic masters into maritime service.<sup id="cite_ref-Julie_Gardiner_2005_pp._11_42-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Julie_Gardiner_2005_pp._11-42"><span>[</span>42<span>]</span></a></sup> There were also a few individuals from continental Europe. An eyewitness testimony right after the sinking refers to a survivor who was a Fleming, and the pilot may very well have been French. Analysis of oxygen isotopes in teeth indicates that some were also of southern European ancestry.<sup id="cite_ref-47" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-47"><span>[</span>47<span>]</span></a></sup> In general they were strong, well-fed men, though many of their bones have tell-tale signs of childhood diseases and a life of grinding toil. The bones also showed traces of numerous healed fractures, probably the result of on-board accidents.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-48"><span>[</span>48<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>There are no extant written records of the make-up of the broader categories of soldiers and sailors, but since the <i>Mary Rose</i> carried some 300 longbows and several thousand arrows there had to be a considerable proportion of <a href="Longbow" title="Longbow">longbow</a> archers. Examination of the skeletal remains has found that there was a disproportionate number of men with a condition known as <i><a href="Os_acromiale" title="Os acromiale" class="mw-redirect">os acromiale</a></i>, affecting their <a href="Shoulder_blade" title="Shoulder blade" class="mw-redirect">shoulder blades</a>. This condition is known among modern elite archery athletes and is caused by placing considerable stress on the arm and shoulder muscles, particularly of the left arm that is used to hold the bow to brace against the pull on the bowstring. Among the men who died on the ship it was likely that some had practised using the longbow since childhood, and served on board as specialist archers.<sup id="cite_ref-49" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-49"><span>[</span>49<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A group of six skeletons were found grouped close to one of the 2-tonne bronze <a href="Culverin" title="Culverin">culverins</a> on the main deck near the bow.

<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> first saw battle in 1512, in a joint naval operation with the Spanish against the French. The English were to meet the French and Breton fleets in the English Channel while the Spanish attacked them in the <a href="Bay_of_Biscay" title="Bay of Biscay">Bay of Biscay</a> and then attack <a href="Gascony" title="Gascony">Gascony</a>. The 35-year-old Sir <a href="Edward_Howard_(admiral)" title="Edward Howard (admiral)">Edward Howard</a> was appointed Lord High Admiral in April and chose the <i>Mary Rose</i> as his <a href="Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>. His first mission was to clear the seas of French naval forces between England to the northern coast of Spain to allow for the landing of supporting troops near the French border at <a href="Fuenterrabia" title="Fuenterrabia" class="mw-redirect">Fuenterrabia</a>. The fleet consisted of 18 ships, among them the large ships the <i>Regent</i> and the <i>Peter Pomegranate</i>, carrying over 5,000 men. Howard's expedition led to the capture of twelve Breton ships and a four day raiding tour of Brittany where English forces successfully fought against local forces and burned numerous settlements.<sup id="cite_ref-51" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-51"><span>[</span>51<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The fleet returned to Southampton in June where it was visited by King Henry. In August the fleet sailed for <a href="Brest,_France" title="Brest, France">Brest</a> where it encountered a joint, but ill-coordinated, French-Breton fleet at the <a href="../Battle_of_St._Mathieu" title="Battle of St. Mathieu" class="mw-redirect">battle of St. Mathieu</a>. The English with one of the great ships in the lead (according to Marsden the <i>Mary Rose</i>) battered the French ships with heavy gunfire and forced them to retreat. The Breton flagship <i><a href="List_of_French_early_battleships" title="List of French early battleships">Cordelière</a></i> put up a fight and was boarded by the 1,000-ton <i>Regent</i>. By accident or through the unwillingness of the Breton crew to surrender, the powder magazine of the <i>Cordelière</i> caught fire and blew up in a violent explosion, setting fire to the <i>Regent</i> and eventually sinking her. About 180 English crew members saved themselves by throwing themselves into the sea and only a handful of Bretons survived, only to be captured. The captain of the <i>Regent</i>, 600 soldiers and sailors, the High Admiral of France and the steward of the town of Morlaix were killed in the incident, making it the focal point of several contemporary chronicles and reports.<sup id="cite_ref-52" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-52"><span>[</span>52<span>]</span></a></sup> On <span class="nowrap">11 August</span>, the English burnt 27 French ships, captured another five and landed forces near Brest to raid and take prisoners, but storms forced the fleet back to <a href="Dartmouth,_Devon" title="Dartmouth, Devon">Dartmouth</a> in <a href="Devon" title="Devon">Devon</a> and then to Southampton for repairs.<sup id="cite_ref-53" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-53"><span>[</span>53<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the spring of 1513, the <i>Mary Rose</i> was once more chosen by Howard as the flagship for an expedition against the French. Before seeing action, however, she took part in a race against other ships where she was deemed to be one of the most nimble and the fastest of the great ships in the fleet (see details under "<a href="#Sails_and_rigging">Sails and rigging</a>"). On <span class="nowrap">11 April</span>, Howard's force arrived off Brest only to see a small enemy force join with the larger force in the safety of Brest harbour and its fortifications.<sup id="cite_ref-54" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-54"><span>[</span>54<span>]</span></a></sup> The French had recently been reinforced by a force of galleys from the Mediterranean, which sank one English ship and seriously damaged another. Howard landed forces near Brest, but made no headway against the town and was by now getting low on supplies. Attempting to force a victory, he took a small force of small oared vessels on a daring frontal attack on the French galleys on <span class="nowrap">25 April</span>. Howard himself managed to reach the ship of French admiral <a href="../../w/index-title=Pr%C3%A9gent_de_Bidoux&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Prégent de Bidoux (page does not exist)">Prégent de Bidoux</a> and led a small party to board it. The French fought back fiercely and cut the cables that attached the two ships, separating Howard from his men. It left him at the mercy of the soldiers aboard the galley, who instantly killed him.<sup id="cite_ref-55" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-55"><span>[</span>55<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Demoralised by the loss of its admiral and seriously short of food, the fleet returned to <a href="Plymouth" title="Plymouth">Plymouth</a>. <a href="Thomas_Howard,_3rd_Duke_of_Norfolk" title="Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk">Thomas Howard</a>, elder brother of Edward, was assigned the new Lord Admiral, and was set to the task of arranging another attack on Brittany. The fleet was not able to mount the planned attack because of adverse winds and great difficulties in supplying the ships adequately and the <i>Mary Rose</i> took up winter quarters in Southampton. In August the Scots joined France in war against England, but were dealt a crushing defeat at the <a href="Battle_of_Flodden" title="Battle of Flodden">Battle of Flodden</a> on <span class="nowrap">9 September</span> 1513. A follow-up attack in early 1514 was supported by a naval force that included the <i>Mary Rose</i>, but without any known engagements.<sup id="cite_ref-56" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-56"><span>[</span>56<span>]</span></a></sup> The French and English mounted raids on each other throughout that summer, but achieved little, and both sides were by then exhausted. By autumn the war was over and a peace treaty was sealed by the marriage of Henry's sister, <a href="Mary_Tudor_(queen_consort_of_France)" title="Mary Tudor (queen consort of France)" class="mw-redirect">Mary</a>, to French king <a href="Louis_XII_of_France" title="Louis XII of France">Louis&#160;XII</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-57" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-57"><span>[</span>57<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>After the peace <i>Mary Rose</i> was placed in the reserves, "in ordinary". She was laid up for maintenance along with her sister ship the <i>Peter Pomegranate</i> in July 1514. In 1518 she received a routine repair and <a href="Caulking" title="Caulking">caulking</a>, waterproofing with <a href="Tar" title="Tar">tar</a> and <a href="Oakum" title="Oakum">oakum</a> (old rope fibres) and was then assigned a small skeleton crew who lived on board the ship until 1522.

<p>In 1522, England was once again at war with France because of a treaty with the Holy Roman Emperor <a href="Charles_V,_Holy_Roman_Emperor" title="Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor">Charles&#160;V</a>. The plan was for an attack on two fronts with an English thrust in northern France.

<p>The <i>Mary Rose</i> was kept in reserve from 1522 to 1545. She was once more caulked and repaired in the summer of 1527 in a newly dug dock at Portsmouth and her <a href="Longboat" title="Longboat">longboat</a> was repaired and trimmed. Little documentation about what happened to the <i>Mary Rose</i> between 1528 and 1539 exists. A document written by <a href="Thomas_Cromwell" title="Thomas Cromwell">Thomas Cromwell</a> in 1536 specifies that the <i>Mary Rose</i> and six other ships were "made new" during his service under the king, though it is unclear which years he was referring to and what "made new" actually meant. A later document from January 1536 by an anonymous author states that the <i>Mary Rose</i> and other ships were "new made", and dating of timbers from the ship confirms some type of repair being done in 1535 or 1536. This would have coincided with the controversial <a href="Dissolution_of_the_monasteries" title="Dissolution of the monasteries" class="mw-redirect">dissolution of the monasteries</a> that resulted in a major influx of funds into the royal treasury.<sup id="cite_ref-61" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-61"><span>[</span>61<span>]</span></a></sup> The nature and extent of this repair is unknown. Many experts, including Margaret Rule, the project leader for the raising of the Mary Rose, have assumed that it meant a complete rebuilding from clinker planking to carvel planking, and that it was only after 1536 that the ship took on the form that it had when it sank and that was eventually recovered in the 20th century. Marsden has speculated that it could even mean that the <i>Mary Rose</i> was originally built in a style that was closer to 15th century ships, with a rounded, rather than square, stern and without the main deck gunports.<sup id="cite_ref-62" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-62"><span>[</span>62<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Henry's complicated marital situation and his high-handed dissolution of the monasteries angered the Pope and Catholic rulers throughout Europe, which increased England's diplomatic isolation. In 1544 Henry had agreed to attack France together with Emperor Charles&#160;V, and English forces captured <a href="Boulogne" title="Boulogne" class="mw-redirect">Boulogne</a> at great cost in September, but soon England was left in the lurch after Charles had achieved his objectives and brokered a <a href="Italian_War_of_1542-1546#Treaty_of_Cr.C3.A9py" title="Italian War of 1542-1546" class="mw-redirect">separate peace</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-63" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-63"><span>[</span>63<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In May 1545, the French had assembled a large fleet in the estuary of the <a href="Seine" title="Seine">Seine</a> with the intent to <a href="French_invasion_of_the_Isle_of_Wight" title="French invasion of the Isle of Wight">land troops on English soil</a>. The estimates of the size of the fleet varied considerably; between 123 and 300 vessels according to French sources; and up to 226 sailing ships and galleys according to the chronicler <a href="Edward_Hall" title="Edward Hall">Edward Hall</a>. In addition to the massive fleet, 50,000 troops were assembled at Havre de Grâce (modern-day <a href="Le_Havre" title="Le Havre">Le Havre</a>). An English force of 160 ships and 12,000 troops under <a href="John_Dudley" title="John Dudley" class="mw-redirect">Viscount Lisle</a> was ready at Portsmouth by early June, before the French were ready to set sail, and an ineffective pre-emptive strike was made in the middle of the month. In early July the huge French force under the command of admiral <a href="Claude_d'Annebault" title="Claude d'Annebault">Claude d'Annebault</a> set sail for England and entered the Solent unopposed with 128 ships on <span class="nowrap">16 July</span>. The English had around 80 ships with which to oppose the French, including the flagship <i>Mary Rose</i>. But since they had virtually no heavy galleys, the vessels that were at their best in sheltered waters like the Solent, the English fleet promptly retreated into Portsmouth harbour.<sup id="cite_ref-64" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-64"><span>[</span>64<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Mary_Rose&action=edit&section=14.php.html" title="Edit section: Battle of the Solent">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Battle_of_the_Solent">Battle of the Solent</span></h3>
<div class="rellink relarticle mainarticle">Main article: <a href="Battle_of_the_Solent" title="Battle of the Solent">Battle of the Solent</a></div>
<p>The English were becalmed in port and unable to manoeuvre. On <span class="nowrap">19 July</span> 1545, the French galleys advanced on the immobilised English fleet, and initially threatened to destroy a force of 13 small galleys, or "rowbarges", the only ships that were able to move against them without a wind. The wind picked up and the sailing ships were able to go on the offensive before the oared vessels were overwhelmed.<sup id="cite_ref-65" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-65"><span>[</span>65<span>]</span></a></sup> Two of the largest ships, the <i>Henry Grace Dieu</i> and the <i>Mary Rose</i>, led the attack on the French galleys in the Solent.</p>
<p>Early in the battle something went wrong. While engaging the French galleys the <i>Mary Rose</i> suddenly heeled (leaned) heavily over to her starboard (right) side and water rushed in through the open gunports.<sup id="cite_ref-66" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-66"><span>[</span>66<span>]</span></a></sup> The crew was powerless to correct the sudden imbalance, and could only scramble for the safety of the upper deck as the ship began to sink rapidly. As she leaned over, equipment, ammunition, supplies and storage containers shifted and came loose, adding to the general chaos. The massive port side brick oven in the <a href="Galley_(kitchen)" title="Galley (kitchen)">galley</a> collapsed completely and the huge 360 litre (90 gallon) copper cauldron was thrown onto the orlop deck above.<sup id="cite_ref-67" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-67"><span>[</span>67<span>]</span></a></sup> Heavy guns came free and slammed into the opposite side, impeding escape or crushing men beneath them.</p>
<p>For those who were not injured or killed outright by moving objects, there was little time to reach safety, especially for the men who were manning the guns on the main deck or fetching ammunition and supplies in the hold. The <a href="Companionway" title="Companionway">companionways</a> that connected the decks with one another would have become bottlenecks for fleeing men, something indicated by the positioning of many of the skeletons recovered from the wreck. What turned the sinking into a major tragedy in terms of lives lost was the anti-boarding netting that covered the upper decks in the waist (the midsection of the ship) and the sterncastle. With the exception of the men who were stationed in the tops in the masts, most of those who managed to get up from below deck were trapped under the netting; they would have been in view of the surface, and their colleagues above, but with little or no chance to break through, and were dragged down with the ship. Out of a crew of at least 400, fewer than 35 escaped, a catastrophic casualty rate of over 90%.<sup id="cite_ref-68" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-68"><span>[</span>68<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

In reply he was told "that he had a sorte of knaves whom he could not rule".<sup id="cite_ref-73" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-73"><span>[</span>73<span>]</span></a></sup> Contrary to all other accounts, <a href="Martin_du_Bellay" title="Martin du Bellay">Martin du Bellay</a>, a French cavalry officer who was present at the battle, stated that the <i>Mary Rose</i> had been sunk by French guns.<sup id="cite_ref-74" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-74"><span>[</span>74<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Mary_Rose&action=edit&section=17.php.html" title="Edit section: Modern theories">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Modern_theories">Modern theories</span></h3>
<p>The most common explanation for the sinking among modern historians is that the ship was unstable for a number of reasons. When a strong gust of wind hit the sails at a critical moment, the open gunports proved fatal, the ship flooded and quickly foundered.<sup id="cite_ref-75" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-75"><span>[</span>75<span>]</span></a></sup> Coates offered a variant of this hypothesis, which explains why a ship which served for several decades without sinking, and which even fought in actions in the rough seas off Brittany, unexpectedly foundered: the ship had accumulated additional weight over the years in service and finally become unseaworthy.<sup id="cite_ref-76" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-76"><span>[</span>76<span>]</span></a></sup> That the ship was turning after firing all the cannons on one side has been questioned by Marsden after examination of guns recovered in both the 19th and 20th centuries; guns from both sides were found still loaded. This has been interpreted to mean that something else could have gone wrong since it is assumed that an experienced crew would not have failed to secure the gunports before making a potentially risky turn.<sup id="cite_ref-77" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-77"><span>[</span>77<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The most recent surveys of the ship indicate that the ship was modified late in her career and has lent support to the idea that the <i>Mary Rose</i> was altered too much to be properly seaworthy. Marsden has suggested that the weight of additional heavy guns would have increased her <a href="Draft_(hull)" title="Draft (hull)">draught</a> so much that the waterline was less than one metre (c. 3 feet) from the gunports on the main deck.<sup id="cite_ref-78" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-78"><span>[</span>78<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Peter Carew's claim of insubordination has been given support by James Watt, former Medical Director-General of the Royal Navy, based on records of an epidemic of <a href="Dysentery" title="Dysentery">dysentery</a> in Portsmouth which could have rendered the crew incapable of handling the ship properly,<sup id="cite_ref-79" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-79"><span>[</span>79<span>]</span></a></sup> while historian Richard Barker has suggested that the crew actually knew that the ship was an accident waiting to happen, at which they balked and refused to follow orders.<sup id="cite_ref-80" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-80"><span>[</span>80<span>]</span></a></sup> Marsden has noted that the Carew biography is in some details inconsistent with the sequence of events reported by both French and English eyewitnesses. It also reports that there were 700 men on board, an unusually high number. The distance in time to the event it describes may mean that it was embellished to add a dramatic touch.<sup id="cite_ref-81" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-81"><span>[</span>81<span>]</span></a></sup> The report of French galleys sinking the <i>Mary Rose</i> as stated by Martin du Bellay has been described as "the account of a courtesan" by naval historian Maurice de Brossard. Du Bellay and his two brothers were close to king <a href="Francis_I_of_France" title="Francis I of France">Francis&#160;I</a> and du Bellay had much to gain from portraying the sinking as a French victory. English sources, even if biased, would have nothing to gain from portraying the sinking as the result of crew incompetence rather conceding to a victory for the much-feared gun galleys.<sup id="cite_ref-82" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-82"><span>[</span>82<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Dominic Fontana, a geographer at the University of Portsmouth, has voiced support for du Bellay's version of the sinking based on the battle as it is depicted in the Cowdray Engraving, and modern <a href="GIS" title="GIS" class="mw-redirect">GIS</a> analysis of the modern scene of the battle. By plotting the fleets and calculating the conjectured final manoeuvres of the <i>Mary Rose</i>, Fontana reached the conclusion that the ship had been hit low in the hull by the galleys and was destabilised after taking in water. He has interpreted the final heading of the ship straight due north as a failed attempt to reach the shallows at <a href="../../w/index-title=Spitbank&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Spitbank (page does not exist)">Spitbank</a> only a few hundred metres away. This theory has been given partial support by Alexzandra Hildred, one of the experts who has worked with the Mary Rose, though she has suggested that the close proximity to Spitbank could also indicate that the sinking occurred while trying to make a hard turn to avoid running aground.<sup id="cite_ref-83" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-83"><span>[</span>83<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 2000, the <a href="Channel_4" title="Channel 4">Channel 4</a> television programme <i>What Sank the Mary Rose</i> attempted to investigate the causes suggested for her sinking by means of experiments with scale models of the ship and metal weights to simulate the presence of troops on the upper decks. Initial tests showed that the ship was able to make the turn described by eyewitnesses without capsizing. In later tests, a fan was used to create a breeze similar to the one reported to have suddenly sprung up on the day of the sinking as the real <i>Mary Rose</i> went to make the turn. As the model made the turn, the breeze in the upper works forced it to heel more than at calm, forcing the main deck gun ports below the <a href="Waterline" title="Waterline">waterline</a> and foundering the model within a few seconds. The sequence of events closely followed what eyewitnesses had reported, particularly the suddenness with which the ship sank.<sup id="cite_ref-84" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-84"><span>[</span>84<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

</div>
</div>
<p>A salvage attempt was ordered by Secretary of State <a href="William_Paget,_1st_Baron_Paget" title="William Paget, 1st Baron Paget">William Paget</a> only days after the sinking, and <a href="Charles_Brandon,_1st_Duke_of_Suffolk" title="Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk">Charles Brandon</a>, the king's brother-in-law, took charge of practical details. The operation followed the standard procedure for raising ships in shallow waters: strong cables were attached to the sunken ship and fastened to two empty ships, or <a href="Hulk_(ship)" title="Hulk (ship)">hulks</a>. At low tide, the ropes were pulled taut with <a href="Capstan_(nautical)" title="Capstan (nautical)">capstans</a>. When the high tide came in, the hulks rose and with them the wreck.

<p>A list of necessary equipment was compiled by 1 August and included, among other things, massive cables, capstans, <a href="Pulleys" title="Pulleys" class="mw-redirect">pulleys</a>, and 40 pounds of <a href="Tallow" title="Tallow">tallow</a> for <a href="Lubrication" title="Lubrication">lubrication</a>.

Brandon was so confident of success that he reassured the king that it would only be a matter of days before they could raise the <i>Mary Rose</i>. However, the optimism proved unfounded. Since the ship had settled at a 60 degree angle to starboard much of it was stuck deep into the clay of the seabed. This made it virtually impossible to pass cables under the hull and required far more lifting power than if the ship had settled on a hard seabed. An attempt to secure cables to the main mast appears only to have resulted in its being snapped off.<sup id="cite_ref-87" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-87"><span>[</span>87<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The project was only successful in raising rigging, some guns and other items.

<p>After the sinking, the partially buried wreck created a barrier at a right angle against the currents of the Solent. Two scour pits, large underwater ditches, formed on either side of the wreck while silt and seaweed was deposited inside the ship. A deep but narrow pit formed on the upward tilting port side, while a shallower, broader pit formed on the starboard side, which had mostly been buried by the force of the impact. The abrasive actions of sand and silt carried by the currents and the activity of fungi, bacteria and wood-boring crustaceans and molluscs, such as the <i><a href="Teredo_navalis" title="Teredo navalis">teredo</a></i> "shipworm", began to break down the structure of the ship. Eventually the exposed wooden structure was weakened and gradually collapsed. The timbers and contents of the port side were deposited in the scour pits and the remaining ship structure, or carried off by the currents. Following the collapse of the exposed parts of the ship the site was levelled with the seabed and was gradually covered by layers of sediment, concealing most of the remaining structure. During the 16th century a hard layer of compacted clay and crushed shells formed over the ship, stabilizing the site and sealing the Tudor-era deposits. Further layers of soft silt covered the site during the 18th and 19th centuries, but frequent changes in the tidal patterns and currents in the Solent occasionally exposed some of the timbers, leading to its accidental rediscovery in 1836 and aided in locating the wreck in 1971.<sup id="cite_ref-91" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-91"><span>[</span>91<span>]</span></a></sup> After the ship had been salvaged it was determined that about 40% of the original structure had survived.<sup id="cite_ref-92" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-92"><span>[</span>92<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In the summer of 1836, a group of five fishermen caught their nets on timbers protruding from the bottom of the Solent. They contacted a diver to help them remove the hindrance, and on <span class="nowrap">10 June</span>, <a href="../../w/index-title=Henry_Abbinett&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Henry Abbinett (page does not exist)">Henry Abbinett</a> became the first person to see the <i>Mary Rose</i> up close in almost 300 years. Later, two other professional divers, <a href="John_Deane_(inventor)" title="John Deane (inventor)">John Deane</a> and William Edwards, were employed to deal with the problem. Using a recently invented rubber suit and metal diving helmet, Deane and Edwards began to examine the wreck and salvage items from it. Along with an assortment of timbers and wooden objects, including several longbows, they brought up several bronze and iron guns, which were sold to the <a href="Board_of_Ordnance" title="Board of Ordnance">Board of Ordnance</a> for over £220. Initially, this caused a dispute between Deane (who had also brought in his brother Charles into the project), Abbinett and the fishermen who had hired them. The matter was eventually settled by allowing the fishermen a share of the proceeds from the sale of the first salvaged guns, while Deane received exclusive salvage rights at the expense of Abbinett. The wreck was soon identified as the <i>Mary Rose</i> from the inscriptions of one of the bronze guns manufactured in 1537.<sup id="cite_ref-93" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-93"><span>[</span>93<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The identification of the ship led to significant public interest in the salvage operation, and caused a great demand for the objects which were brought up. Though many of the objects could not be properly conserved at the time and subsequently deteriorated, many were documented with pencil sketches and watercolour drawings which survive to this day. John Deane ceased working on the wreck in 1836, but returned in 1840 with new, more destructive methods. With the help of condemned bomb shells filled with gunpowder acquired from the Ordnance Board he blasted his way into parts of the wreck. Fragments of bombs and traces of blasting craters were found during the modern excavations, but there was no evidence that Deane managed to penetrate the hard layer that had sealed off the Tudor levels. Deane reported retrieving a <a href="Bilge_pump" title="Bilge pump">bilge pump</a> and the lower part of the main mast, both of which would have been located inside the ship. The recovery of small wooden objects like longbows, suggest that Deane did manage to penetrate the Tudor levels at some point, though this has been disputed by the excavation project leader <a href="Margaret_Rule" title="Margaret Rule">Margaret Rule</a>. Newspaper reports on Deane's diving operations in October 1840 report that the ship was clinker built, but since the sterncastle is the only part of the ship with this feature, an alternative explanation has been suggested: Deane did not penetrate the hard shelly layer that covered most of the ship, but only managed to get into remains of the sterncastle that today no longer exist. Despite the rough handling by Deane the <i>Mary Rose</i> escaped the wholesale destruction by giant rakes and explosives that was the fate of other wrecks in the Solent.<sup id="cite_ref-94" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-94"><span>[</span>94<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The modern search for the <i>Mary Rose</i> was initiated by the Southsea branch of the British Sub-Aqua Club in 1965 as part of a project to locate shipwrecks in the Solent. The project was under the leadership of historian, journalist and amateur diver <a href="Alexander_McKee_(author)" title="Alexander McKee (author)">Alexander McKee</a>. Another group led by Lieutenant-Commander <a href="../../w/index-title=Alan_Bax&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Alan Bax (page does not exist)">Alan Bax</a> of the Royal Navy, sponsored by the Committee for Nautical Archaeology in London, also formed a search team. Initially the two teams had differing views on where to find the wreck, but eventually joined forces. In February 1966 a chart from 1841 was found that marked the positions of the <i>Mary Rose</i> and several other wrecks. The charted position coincided with a trench (one of the scour pits) that had already been located by McKee's team, and a definite location was finally established at a position 3.0&#160;km (1.9&#160;mi) south of the entrance to <a href="Portsmouth_Harbour" title="Portsmouth Harbour">Portsmouth Harbour</a> (<span class="plainlinks nourlexpansion"><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://toolserver.org/~geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Mary_Rose&params=50_46__N_1_06__W_"><span class="geo-default"><span class="geo-dms" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location"><span class="latitude">50°46′N</span> <span class="longitude">1°06′W</span></span></span><span class="geo-multi-punct">﻿ / ﻿</span><span class="geo-nondefault"><span class="geo-dec" title="Maps, aerial photos, and other data for this location">50.76667°N 1.1°W</span><span style="display:none">﻿ / <span class="geo">50.76667; -1.1</span></span></span></a></span>) in water with a depth of <span class="nowrap">11 m</span> (36&#160;feet) at low tide.<sup id="cite_ref-95" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-95"><span>[</span>95<span>]</span></a></sup> Diving on the site began in 1966 and a sonar scan by <a href="Harold_Edgerton" title="Harold Edgerton" class="mw-redirect">Harold Edgerton</a> in 1967–68 revealed some type of buried feature. In 1970 a loose timber was located and on <span class="nowrap">5 May</span> 1971, the first structural details of the buried hull were identified after they were partially uncovered by winter storms.<sup id="cite_ref-96" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-96"><span>[</span>96<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A major problem for the team from the start was that wrecksites in the UK lacked any legal protection from plunderers and treasure hunters. Sunken ships, once being moving objects, were legally treated as <a href="Chattel" title="Chattel" class="mw-redirect">chattel</a> and were awarded to those who could first raise them. The <a href="Merchant_Shipping_Act" title="Merchant Shipping Act">Merchant Shipping Act</a> of 1894 also stipulated that any objects raised from a wreck should be auctioned off to finance the salvage operations, and there was nothing preventing anyone from "stealing" the wreck and making a profit. The problem was handled by forming an organisation, the Mary Rose Committee, aiming "to find, excavate, raise and preserve for all time such remains of the ship <i>Mary Rose</i> as may be of historical or archaeological interest".<sup id="cite_ref-97" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-97"><span>[</span>97<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>To keep intruders at bay, the Committee arranged a lease of the seabed where the wreck lay from the Portsmouth authorities, thereby discouraging anyone from trespassing on the underwater property. In hindsight this was only a legalistic charade which had little chance of holding up in a court of law. In combination with secrecy as to the exact location of the wreck, however, it saved the project from interference. It was not until the passing of the <a href="Protection_of_Wrecks_Act" title="Protection of Wrecks Act" class="mw-redirect">Protection of Wrecks Act</a> on <span class="nowrap">5 February</span> 1973 that the <i>Mary Rose</i> was declared to be of national historic interest that enjoyed full legal protection from any disturbance by commercial salvage teams. Despite this, years after the passing of the 1973 act and the excavation of the ship, lingering conflicts with salvage legislation remained a threat to the <i>Mary Rose</i> project as "personal" finds such as chests, clothing and cooking utensils risked being confiscated and auctioned off.<sup id="cite_ref-98" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-98"><span>[</span>98<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Following the discovery of the wreck in 1971, the project became known to the general public and received increasing media attention. This helped bring in more donations and equipment, primarily from private sources. By 1974 the Committee had representatives from the <a href="National_Maritime_Museum" title="National Maritime Museum">National Maritime Museum</a>, the <a href="Royal_Navy" title="Royal Navy">Royal Navy</a>, the <a href="BBC" title="BBC">BBC</a> and local organisations. In 1974 the project received royal patronage from <a href="Charles,_Prince_of_Wales" title="Charles, Prince of Wales">Prince Charles</a>, who participated in dives on the site. This attracted yet more publicity, and also more funding and assistance.<sup id="cite_ref-99" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-99"><span>[</span>99<span>]</span></a></sup> The initial aims of the Mary Rose Committee were now more officially and definitely confirmed. The Committee had become a registered charity in 1974, which made it easier to raise funds, and the application for excavation and salvage had been officially approved by the UK government.<sup id="cite_ref-100" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-100"><span>[</span>100<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>By 1978 the initial excavation work had uncovered a complete and coherent site with an intact ship structure and the orientation of the hull had been positively identified as being on an almost straight northerly heading with a 60 degree heel to starboard and a slight downward tilt towards the bow. As no records of English shipbuilding techniques used in vessels like the <i>Mary Rose</i> survive, excavation of the ship would allow for a detailed survey of her design and shed new light on the construction of ships of the era.<sup id="cite_ref-101" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-101"><span>[</span>101<span>]</span></a></sup> A full excavation however, also meant removing the protective layers of silt that prevented the remaining ship structure from being destroyed through biological decay and the scouring of the currents; the operation had to be completed within a predetermined timespan of a few years or it risked irreversible damage. It was also considered desirable to recover and preserve the remains of the hull if possible. For the first time, the project was faced with the practical difficulties of actually raising, conserving and preparing the hull for public display.<sup id="cite_ref-102" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-102"><span>[</span>102<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>To handle this new, considerably more complex and expensive task, it was decided that a new organisation was needed.

In 1979 a new diving vessel was purchased to replace the previous 12&#160;m (40&#160;ft) catamaran <i>Roger Greenville</i> which had been used from 1971. The choice fell on the salvage vessel <i>Sleipner</i>, the same craft that had been used as a platform for diving operations on the <i>Vasa</i>. The project went from a team of only twelve volunteers working four months a year to over 50 individuals working almost around the clock nine months a year. In addition there were over 500 volunteer divers and a laboratory staff of about 70 that ran the shore base and conservation facilities.<sup id="cite_ref-104" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-104"><span>[</span>104<span>]</span></a></sup> During the four diving seasons from 1979 to 1982 over 22,000 diving hours was spent on the site, an effort that amounted to 11.8 man years.<sup id="cite_ref-105" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-105"><span>[</span>105<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Raising the <i>Mary Rose</i> meant overcoming a number of delicate problems that had never been encountered before. The salvage of the Swedish warship <i><a href="Vasa_(ship)" title="Vasa (ship)">Vasa</a></i> 1959–61 was the only comparable precedent, but it had been a relatively straightforward operation since the hull was completely intact and rested upright on the seabed. It had been raised with basically the same methods as were in use in Tudor England: cables were slung under the hull and attached to two pontoons on either side of the ship which was then gradually raised and towed into shallower waters. Only one third of the <i>Mary Rose</i> was intact and she lay deeply embedded in mud. If the hull were raised in the traditional way, there was no guarantee that it would have enough structural strength to hold together out of water. Many suggestions for salvage were discarded, including the construction of a <a href="Cofferdam" title="Cofferdam">cofferdam</a> around the wreck site, filling the ship with small buoyant objects (such as ping pong balls) or even pumping brine into the seabed and freezing it so that it would float and take the hull with it. After lengthy discussions it was decided in February 1980 that the hull would first be emptied of all its contents and strengthened with steel braces and frames. It would then be lifted to the surface with floating <a href="Sheerleg" title="Sheerleg">sheerlegs</a> attached to nylon strops passing under the hull and transferred to a cradle. It was also decided that the ship would be recovered before the end of the diving season in 1982. If the wreck stayed uncovered any longer it risked irreversible damage from biological decay and tidal scouring.<sup id="cite_ref-106" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-106"><span>[</span>106<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>During the last year of the operation, the massive scope of full excavation and salvage was beginning to take its toll on those closely involved in the project. In May 1981 Alexander McKee voiced concerns about the method chosen for the salvage and openly questioned Margaret Rule's position as excavation leader. McKee felt ignored in what he viewed as a project where he had always played a central role, both as the initiator of the search for the <i>Mary Rose</i> and other ships in the Solent, and as an active member throughout the diving operations. He had several supporters who all pointed to the risk of the project's turning into an embarrassing failure if the ship were damaged during salvage. To address these concerns it was suggested that the hull should be placed on top of a supporting steel cradle underwater. This would avoid the inherent risks of damaging the wooden structure if it were lifted out of the water without appropriate support. The idea of using nylon strops was also discarded in favour of drilling holes through the hull at 170 points and passing iron bolts through them to allow the attachment of wires connected to a lifting frame.<sup id="cite_ref-107" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-107"><span>[</span>107<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The wreck of the <i>Mary Rose</i> clear of the water on 11 October 1982</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>In the spring of 1982, after three intense seasons of archaeological underwater work, preparations began for the salvage. The operation soon ran into problems: early on there were difficulties with the custom-made lifting equipment; divers on the project belonging to the Royal Engineers had to be pulled because of the outbreak of the <a href="Falklands_War" title="Falklands War">Falklands War</a>; and the method of lifting the hull had to be considerably altered as late as June. After the frame was properly attached to the hull it was slowly jacked up on four legs straddling the wreck site to pull the ship off the seabed. The massive crane of the barge <i>Tog Mor</i> was then used to lift the frame and hull on to the specially designed cradle which was padded with water-filled bags. On the morning of <span class="nowrap">11 October</span> 1982, the final lift of the entire package of cradle, hull and lifting frame began. At 9:03 the first timbers of the <i>Mary Rose</i> broke the surface in the presence of the salvaging team, Prince Charles and curious spectators on boats circling the site. A second set of bags under the hull was inflated with air to cushion the waterlogged wood and finally the whole package was transferred to the barge that would take the hull ashore. Though eventually successful, the salvage operation was close to floundering on two occasions; first when one of the supporting legs of the lifting frame was bent and had to be removed and later when a corner of the frame, with "an unforgettable crunch",<sup id="cite_ref-108" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-108"><span>[</span>108<span>]</span></a></sup> slipped more than a metre (3&#160;feet) and came close to crushing part of the hull.<sup id="cite_ref-109" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-109"><span>[</span>109<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<h2><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Mary_Rose&action=edit&section=25.php.html" title="Edit section: Archaeology">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Archaeology">Archaeology</span></h2>
<p>As one of the most ambitious and expensive projects in the history of <a href="Maritime_archaeology" title="Maritime archaeology">maritime archaeology</a>, the <i>Mary Rose</i> project broke new ground within this field in the UK.<sup id="cite_ref-110" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-110"><span>[</span>110<span>]</span></a></sup> Besides becoming one of the first wrecks to be protected under the new <a href="Protection_of_Wrecks_Act" title="Protection of Wrecks Act" class="mw-redirect">Protection of Wrecks Act</a> in 1973 it also created several new precedents. It was the first time that a British privately funded project was able to fully apply modern scientific standards and without having to auction off part of the findings to finance its activities; where previous projects often had to settle for just a partial recovery of finds, everything found in connection with the <i>Mary Rose</i> was recovered and recorded. The salvage made it possible to establish the first historic shipwreck museum in the UK to receive government accreditation and funding. The excavation of the <i>Mary Rose</i> wrecksite proved that it was possible to achieve a level of exactness in underwater excavations comparable to those on dry land.<sup id="cite_ref-111" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-111"><span>[</span>111<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Throughout the 1970s, the <i>Mary Rose</i> was meticulously surveyed, excavated and recorded with the latest methods within the field of <a href="Maritime_archaeology" title="Maritime archaeology">maritime archaeology</a>. Working in an underwater environment meant that principles of land-based archaeology did not always apply. Mechanical excavators, <a href="Airlift_(dredging_device)" title="Airlift (dredging device)">airlifts</a> and suction dredges were used in the process of locating the wreck, but as soon as it began to be uncovered in earnest, more delicate techniques were employed.<sup id="cite_ref-112" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-112"><span>[</span>112<span>]</span></a></sup> Many objects from the <i>Mary Rose</i> had been well preserved in form and shape, but many were quite delicate, requiring careful handling. Artefacts of all sizes were supported with soft packing material, such as old plastic ice cream containers, and some of the arrows that were "soft like cream cheese" had to be brought up in special styrofoam containers.<sup id="cite_ref-113" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-113"><span>[</span>113<span>]</span></a></sup> The airlifts that sucked up clay, sand and dirt off-site or to the surface were still used, but with much greater precision since they could potentially disrupt the site. The many layers of sediment that had accumulated on the site could be used to date artefacts in which they were found, and had to be recorded properly. The various types of accretions and remnants of chemicals with artefacts were essential clues to objects that had long since broken down and disappeared, and needed to be treated with considerable care.<sup id="cite_ref-114" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-114"><span>[</span>114<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The excavation and salvage in the 1970s and early '80s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding and part of the bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the high costs of conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new <a href="Aircraft_carrier" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carriers</a>. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed to make sure that they could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the <i>Mary Rose</i> wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten metre (32&#160;feet) <a href="Stem_(ship)" title="Stem (ship)">stem</a>, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.<sup id="cite_ref-115" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-115"><span>[</span>115<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

One of the many <a href="Rosary" title="Rosary">rosaries</a> found on the <i>Mary Rose</i> that once belonged to one of the lower-ranking crew members</div>
</div>

<p>Along with remains of about half the crew members, over 26,000 artefacts and pieces of timber were salvaged.<sup id="cite_ref-116" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-116"><span>[</span>116<span>]</span></a></sup> As the ship was intended to function as a floating, self-contained community, it was stocked with <a href="Victuals" title="Victuals" class="mw-redirect">victuals</a> (food and drink) that could sustain its inhabitants for extended periods of time. The <a href="Cask" title="Cask" class="mw-redirect">casks</a> used for storage on the <i>Mary Rose</i> have been compared with those from a wreck of a trade vessel from the 1560s and have revealed that they were of better quality, more robust and reliable, an indication that supplies for the <a href="Tudor_navy" title="Tudor navy">Tudor navy</a> were given high priority and set a high standard for cask manufacturing at the time.<sup id="cite_ref-117" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-117"><span>[</span>117<span>]</span></a></sup> As a miniature society at sea, the wreck of the <i>Mary Rose</i> contained objects that belonged to individual crew members.

<p>The ship carried several skilled craftsmen and was equipped for handling both routine maintenance and repairing extensive battle damage. In and around one of the cabins on the main deck under the sterncastle archaeologists found a "collection of woodworking tools&#160;... unprecedented in its range and size", consisting of eight chests of carpentry tools.

<p>Two <a href="Fiddle" title="Fiddle">fiddles</a>, a bow, a still <a href="Shawm" title="Shawm">shawm</a> or <i>doucaine</i>, three <a href="Three-hole_pipe" title="Three-hole pipe">three-hole pipes</a> and a <a href="Tabor_(instrument)" title="Tabor (instrument)">tabor drum</a> with a drumstick were found throughout the wreck.

The tabor drum is the earliest known example of its kind and the drumstick of a previously unknown design. The tabor pipes are considerably longer than any known examples from the period and their discovery proved that contemporary illustrations, previously viewed with some suspicion, were in fact accurate depictions of the actual instruments. Before the discovery of the <i>Mary Rose</i> shawm, an early predecessor to the <a href="Oboe" title="Oboe">oboe</a>, instrument historians had been puzzled by reference to "still shawms", or "soft" shawms, that were said to have a sound that was less shrill than earlier shawms.<sup id="cite_ref-124" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-124"><span>[</span>124<span>]</span></a></sup> The still shawm disappeared from the musical scene some time in the 16th century and the <i>Mary Rose</i> example is the only surviving example.

The <i>Mary Rose</i> being sprayed with water at the facility in Portsmouth in March 1984. Between December 1984 and July 1985 the steel cradle was gradually rotated to stand with the keel in an almost upright position.<sup id="cite_ref-130" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-130"><span>[</span>130<span>]</span></a></sup></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Preservation of the <i>Mary Rose</i> and her contents was an essential part of the project from the start. Though many artefacts, especially those that were buried in silt, had been preserved, the long exposure to an underwater environment had rendered most of them sensitive to exposure to air after recovery. Archaeologists and conservators had to work in tandem from the start to prevent deterioration of the artefacts.<sup id="cite_ref-131" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-131"><span>[</span>131<span>]</span></a></sup> After recovery, finds were placed in so-called passive storage, which would prevent any immediate deterioration before the active conservation which would allow them to be stored in an open-air environment. Passive storage depended on the type of material that the object was made of, and could vary considerably. Smaller objects from the most common material, wood, were sealed in polyethylene bags to preserve moisture. Timbers and other objects that were too large to be wrapped were stored in unsealed water tanks. Growth of fungi and microbes that could degrade wood were controlled by various techniques, including low-temperature storage, chemicals, and in the case of large objects, common <a href="Pond_snail" title="Pond snail" class="mw-redirect">pond snails</a> that consumed wood-degrading organisms but not the wood itself.<sup id="cite_ref-132" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-132"><span>[</span>132<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Other organic materials such as leather, skin and textiles were treated similarly, by keeping them moist in tanks or sealed plastic containers. Bone and ivory was <a href="Desalinization" title="Desalinization" class="mw-redirect">desalinated</a> to prevent damage from salt crystallisation, as was glass, ceramic and stone. Iron, copper and copper alloy objects were kept moist in a <a href="Sodium_sesquicarbonate" title="Sodium sesquicarbonate">sodium sesquicarbonate</a> solution to prevent oxidisation and reaction with the <a href="Chloride" title="Chloride">chlorides</a> that had penetrated the surface. Alloys of lead and pewter are inherently stable in the atmosphere and generally require no special treatment. Silver and gold were the only materials that required no special passive storage.<sup id="cite_ref-133" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-133"><span>[</span>133<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

The hull of the <i>Mary Rose</i> being sprayed at the facility in Portsmouth while a technician is servicing the system</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Conserving the hull of the Mary Rose was the most complicated and expensive task for the project. In 2002 a donation of <span class="nowrap">£4.8 million</span> from the <a href="Heritage_Lottery_Fund" title="Heritage Lottery Fund">Heritage Lottery Fund</a> and equivalent monetary support from the Portsmouth City and Hampshire County Councils was needed to keep the work with conservation on schedule.<sup id="cite_ref-134" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-134"><span>[</span>134<span>]</span></a></sup> During passive conservation, the ship structure could for practical reasons not be completely sealed, so instead it was regularly sprayed with filtered, recycled water that was kept at a temperature of 2 to 5&#160;°C (35 to 41&#160;°F) to keep it from drying out.<sup id="cite_ref-135" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-135"><span>[</span>135<span>]</span></a></sup> Drying waterlogged wood that has been submerged for several centuries without appropriate conservation causes considerable shrinkage (20–50%) and leads to severe warping and cracking as water evaporates from the cellular structure of the wood. The substance <a href="Polyethylene_glycol" title="Polyethylene glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> (PEG) had been used before on archaeological wood, and was during the 1980s being used to conserve the <i><a href="Vasa_(ship)" title="Vasa (ship)">Vasa</a></i>. After almost ten years of small-scale trials on timbers, an active three-phase conservation programme of the hull of the <i>Mary Rose</i> began in 1994. During the first phase, which lasted from 1994 to 2003 the wood was sprayed with low-molecular-weight PEG to replace the water in the cellular structure of the wood. From 2003 to 2010 a higher-molecular-weight PEG was used to strengthen the mechanical properties of the outer surface layers. The third phase will consist of a controlled air drying that will last three to five years, giving a final date of complete conservation of the <i>Mary Rose</i> no later than 2015.<sup id="cite_ref-136" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-136"><span>[</span>136<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>Since the decision to salvage the <i>Mary Rose</i> was taken, there had been discussion of where she would eventually go on permanent display. The east end of <a href="Portsea_Island" title="Portsea Island">Portsea Island</a> at <a href="Eastney" title="Eastney">Eastney</a> emerged as an early alternative, but was rejected because of parking problems and the distance from the dockyard where she was originally built. Placing the ship next to the famous flagship of <a href="Horatio_Nelson" title="Horatio Nelson" class="mw-redirect">Horatio Nelson</a>, <a href="HMS_Victory" title="HMS Victory">HMS <i>Victory</i></a> at <a href="Portsmouth_Historic_Dockyard" title="Portsmouth Historic Dockyard" class="mw-redirect">Portsmouth Historic Dockyard</a> was proposed in July 1981. A group called the Maritime Preservation Society even suggested <a href="Southsea_Castle" title="Southsea Castle">Southsea Castle</a>, where Henry&#160;VIII had witnessed the sinking, as a final resting place and there was widespread scepticism to the dockyard location. At one point a county councillor even threatened to withdraw promised funds if the dockyard site became more than an interim solution. As costs for the project mounted, there was also a debate in the Council chamber and in the local paper <i><a href="Portsmouth_News" title="Portsmouth News" class="mw-redirect">The News</a></i> whether the money could be spent more appropriately. Although author David Childs writes that in the early 1980s "the debate was as a fiery one", the project was never seriously threatened because of the great symbolic importance of the <i>Mary Rose</i> to the naval history of both Portsmouth and England.<sup id="cite_ref-137" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-137"><span>[</span>137<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Since the mid-1980s, the hull of the <i>Mary Rose</i> has been kept in a covered dry dock while undergoing conservation. Although the hull has been open to the public for viewing, the need for keeping the ship saturated first with water and later a <a href="Polyethylene_glycol" title="Polyethylene glycol">polyethylene glycol</a> (PEG) solution has meant that visitors have been separated from the hull by a glass barrier. Despite this, the specially built ship hall had been visited by over seven million visitors as of 2007, since it first opened on <span class="nowrap">4 October</span> 1983, just under a year after it was successfully salvaged.<sup id="cite_ref-138" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-138"><span>[</span>138<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>A separate <a href="Mary_Rose_Museum" title="Mary Rose Museum">Mary Rose Museum</a> is housed in a structure called No. 5 Boathouse near the ship hall and was opened to the public on <span class="nowrap">9 July</span> 1984.<sup id="cite_ref-139" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-139"><span>[</span>139<span>]</span></a></sup> It contains displays explaining the history of the ship and conserved artefacts, from entire bronze cannons to household items. A new museum has been planned since 2005 where the fully conserved hull will be displayed in a way that allows visitors to come up close, without restrictive visual barriers.<sup id="cite_ref-140" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-140"><span>[</span>140<span>]</span></a></sup> In September 2009 the temporary <i>Mary Rose</i> display hall was finally closed to visitors to facilitate construction of the new <span class="nowrap">£35 million</span> museum building, which is expected to open to the public in 2012.<sup id="cite_ref-141" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-141"><span>[</span>141<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
