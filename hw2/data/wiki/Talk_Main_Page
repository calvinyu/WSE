<p><big>To report an error you have noticed on <a href="Main_Page" title="Main Page">today's</a> or <a href="Wikipedia_Main_Page/Tomorrow" title="Wikipedia:Main Page/Tomorrow">tomorrow's</a> Main Page, please add it to the appropriate section below.</big></p>
<p>Please note the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Where is the error?:</b> The more specific you can be (an exact item, for example "item number&#160;3 on DYK"; or a sentence) the faster an admin can find it.</li>
<li><b>Be specific:</b> Errors can be fixed faster when a correction is offered.</li>
<li><b>References:</b> Can be helpful, especially when reporting an obscure factual or grammatical error.</li>
<li><b>Consensus:</b> Remember that the Main Page usually defers to supporting pages for accuracy or when there is disagreement, so it is best to achieve consensus and make any necessary changes there first.</li>
<li><b>Time zones:</b> Note that <a href="Coordinated_Universal_Time" title="Coordinated Universal Time">Coordinated Universal Time</a> is used for the current date and time (01:05 on 14&#160;Feb&#160;2013), and this may not coincide with your local <a href="Time_zone" title="Time zone">time zone</a>.</li>
<li><b>Should I use {{<a href="Template_Edit_protected" title="Template:Edit protected">edit protected</a>}}?:</b> No. Using {{edit protected}} here will <u>not</u> give you a faster response, and in fact breaks the template when it is placed directly on the Main Page Errors page instead of on a <a href="Help_Using_talk_pages" title="Help:Using talk pages">talk page</a>.</li>
<li><b>Done?:</b> Once an error has been fixed, the error report will be removed from this page; please check the page's <span class="plainlinks"><a class="external text" href="../../w/index-title=Wikipedia_Main_Page_Errors&action=history.php.html">history</a></span> to verify that the error has been rectified and for any other comments the administrator may have made.</li>
<li><b>No chit-chat:</b> Lengthy discussions should be moved to a suitable location elsewhere.</li>

<p>Mentioning the "leader of the Catholic Church" in the blurb sounds inappropriate and resembles too much as it is a political position.

<dd>I wasn't necessarily saying that more OTD hooks is a problem. Then again, do we really want that many? Possibly ten? And I'm quite certain there are some days that don't have enough hooks in reserve so we'd need to create some new ones. This isn't a problem if the coordination has already begun, but given that's a successful implementation, I'm not sure it has. I feel like I contribute to the Main Page a lot and this is the first time I've heard of the proposal. I imagine at some point, someone would have contacted the DYK, ITN, and OTD projects to figure out how the content in those three sections might need to change to accommodate TAFI.</dd>

<dd>I agree. TAFI was meant to slip in neatly at the bottom of the left hand column with "<i>Help Wikipedia and join fellow editors in building _______ - today's Article for Improvement</i>" and a random list - not several multi-linked hooks (why give alternative wikilinks if you want people to go to one article, incidentally?) The present mock-up also creates undesirable amounts of whitespace. So either TFA/DYK have to be cut back, or ITN/OTD have to be expanded. Neither consequence was part of the original proposal so there is no consensus for anything other than the previously approved wording and minimalist design. <a href="User_Bencherlite" title="User:Bencherlite">Bencherlite</a><a href="User_talk_Bencherlite" title="User talk:Bencherlite"><i><sup>Talk</sup></i></a> 22:15, 7 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I missed the discussion, and I've been assisting with the section's subsequent development to improve its format and address concerns that I was unable to raise. It's quite true that the current draft differs significantly from the one originally proposed and shouldn't be implemented without further discussion.</dd>
<dd>In my opinion, the section shouldn't even be added to the column (due to the aforementioned balance issue), but I didn't learn of the plan until after such consensus was established. My assumption has been that the other sections will be adjusted to compensate, but I agree that their organizers should have been contacted in advance and encouraged to comment.</dd>
<dd>One possibility that occurred to me today is to expand OTD to include a mini-TFA-style writeup about one selected anniversary, ideally pointing to a good or featured article.

<dl>
<dd>That's not always possible. Not every day has an event which is written to FA or GA standards. There are even 1 or 2 days where there are only 5 eligible articles, making it impossible to expand OTD on those days. <span style="font-family:Verdana;">—<b><a href="User_Howcheng" title="User:Howcheng"><span style="color:#33C;">howcheng</span></a></b> <small>{<a href="User_talk_Howcheng" title="User talk:Howcheng">chat</a>}</small></span> 22:48, 7 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I'm aware that not every date has a GA or FA (hence "ideally") and that some dates have few or no eligible articles in reserve.</dd>
<dd>The rough idea (which obviously hasn't been fully fleshed out or tested) is to highlight one of the better articles (GA or FA if available) with the image and a longer blurb, without necessarily increasing the total number of items. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 23:00, 7 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>And that may very well be a reasonable idea. I wasn't necessarily trying to suggest TAFI is a bad idea; it's just a bit surprising that it has already matured to the stage of imminent implementation when issues like this have not been ironed out. We shouldn't have to hastily come up with a solution; this should have already been decided. And if the solution was to lengthen OTD, fine. If it was to shorten DYK, fine. But the mockup by Nick was called a successful implementation, so I don't think a solution to this obvious problem had been considered until this thread. And that doesn't even account for the other issues (regarding whether consensus was really reached) that others have brought up. -- <b><a href="User_Tariqabjotu" title="User:Tariqabjotu"><font color="black">tariq</font><font color="gray">abjotu</font></a></b> 00:48, 8 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>The matter was addressed in an earlier draft, which contained static simulations of the various sections (with extra items added to ITN and OTD). The current version contains live transclusions of the actual main page sections (which obviously haven't been padded to compensate for the imbalance). By "successfully implemented", I believe that NickPenguin was referring to the TAFI transclusion (including the randomization code), which no longer is simulated.<br />
I agree, of course, that further discussion and planning are needed. Personally, I don't believe that any new section should be added to either column unless and until we're prepared to also add a new section or subsection to the other column. Otherwise, ITN and OTD (especially the former, at which staleness already is a problem) will become badly overloaded. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 01:10, 8 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I have to agree with others that more centralised discussion is needed. On a personal note, I was aware of the discussion but purposely did not join in because I was undecided and the details of how it was going to be implemented were fairly unclear, e.g. there was the concern about edit conflicts and the proposal for randomisation. I therefore assumed one a proper proposal was implemented which I could actualy judge, this would be discussed again as seems to be the norm for serious chages to the main page. I'm not convinced I was the only one in that regard.</dd>
<dd>Incidentally how was the original discussion particularly the implementation proposals advertised? For example, AFAIK, the advertisiment for here being the main page talk page seemed poor. There was some mention of TAFI here <a href="Archive_171/index.html#WP:TAFI" title="Talk:Main Page/Archive 171">Talk:Main Page/Archive 171#WP:TAFI</a> but that was before the VPP discussion had started. AFAIK, the next mention was <a href="Archive_172/index.html#WP:TAFI_proposal" title="Talk:Main Page/Archive 172">Talk:Main Page/Archive 172#WP:TAFI proposal</a> where it was presented as an idea which already had consensus despite not being even mentioned on the talk page of where it was going to be implemented (from memory this is when I became aware of the proposal). While the discussion continued (most of it came after the mention here and the subsequent addition to CENT) this isn't a great form of advertisement. Someone else mentioned that had been no advertisement at <a href="Wikipedia_CENT" title="Wikipedia:CENT" class="mw-redirect">WP:CENT</a>, which was later rectified.</dd>
<dd>I would note while there was some discussion of the implementation details in the VPP discussion, this began after the non-advertisement advertisement here and no one ever told us the discussion had expanded in that way AFAIK. Was it noted at WP:CENT where from the time stamps I think the advertisement was also added before the discussion had expanded? Definitely over half the main line comments to the basic yes/no proposal are timestamped before the discussion began on implementation details although I haven't checked to see how many people in that group left a latter comment such as in the implementation discussion. And if you look at the discussion on the implemented details the participation was rather limited and while I don't think less participation in such nitty gritty is uncommon, it doesn't help if people aren't aware. Remember that there's no reason to expect people are going to hang around a discussion, many leave their comments and don't come back. And some may check out a discussion and decide not to leave comments like I did. Unless it's advertised neither have any way of knowing nor any reason to think, the discussion has expanded, even if the old advert remains in place. Don't get me wrong, it does seem there is consensus for something, but precisely what isn't clear to me and whatever it is, it doesn't seem to be what is shown here.</dd>
<dd>(In case it isn't clear, I also think this has been an example of how 'not' to propose a change to the main page. This isn't a criticism of anyone involved, simply a suggestion for future proposals, such as for any further discussion on this proposal. Beyond the problems highlighted, I would note there was about 1.5 times the total&#160;!votes for <a href="Archive_171/index.html#GA_Main_Page_slot_proposal" title="Talk:Main Page/Archive 171">Talk:Main Page/Archive 171#GA Main Page slot proposal</a> which failed as there was for the basic yes/no TAFI proposal. I know&#160;!vote counting isn't a brilliant method of determining participation, it depends significant on strength of feelings and other factors but it is one gauge. Not that the discussion GA discussion is a great example anyway as it was evidently competing with <a href="Wikipedia_talk_Did_you_know/Archive_86#One_GA_per_shift.3F_Jimmy.27s_on_board_for_reforming_DYK" title="Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 86">Wikipedia talk:Did you know/Archive 86#One GA per shift? Jimmy's on board for reforming DYK</a>, a highly related proposal occurring in a different area which got over double the&#160;!votes as the one on WT:MP, although that may have also been because it proposed modifying a section.)</dd>

<dd>Well. I think we can all agree that my phrasing was less than ideal. I think we can also all agree that something is going on with TAFI that has gone largely unnoticed, but needs to be dealt with more succinctly by the community at large. Having read as many of the background discussions as I can find, my feeling is that there is general support to have TAFI on the Main Page.</dd>
<dd>However, the more I think about this, the more I feel this is going to get tightly rolled into the <a href="Wikipedia_talk_2013_main_page_redesign_proposal" title="Wikipedia talk:2013 main page redesign proposal">Wikipedia talk:2013 main page redesign proposal</a>. Mostly because the current structure has become so rigid and glass-like that any attempt to integrate a new element will be met with difficulty. I also have a feeling that the latest redesign proposal is going to be successful, which is good.</dd>
<dd>So my question is, how do we proceed? Should we implement something for TAFI on the Main Page in parallel with the Redesign Proposal, or focus solely on the redesign? Truthfully the TAFI process seems to be chugging along, and it would be a waste if the system cannot be fully implemented in the near future. --<a href="User_NickPenguin" title="User:NickPenguin"><font color="darkgreen">Nick</font></a><a href="User_talk_NickPenguin" title="User talk:NickPenguin"><font color="darkblue">Penguin</font></a><sub>(<a href="Special_Contributions/NickPenguin" title="Special:Contributions/NickPenguin"><font color="blue"><b>contribs</b></font></a>)</sub> 07:51, 8 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>In my experience, TFA + DYK is usually longer (sometimes quite a bit longer) than ITN + OTD, so perhaps the solution might be to switch it to the right-hand column?

<dd>Such placement would have no thematic basis. The left-hand column highlights Wikipedia's most polished articles and newly created/expanded articles, so appending links to articles in need of improvement at the bottom is a natural progression.

<dd><span class="inline-quote-talk2" style="font-style: italic; color: #008000;">There's a rather weak thematic link, imo, between TFA (our best articles) and articles for improvement (some of our worst)</span></dd>
<dd>1. Wikipedia contains <i>far</i> worse articles than those selected for TAFI.</dd>
<dd>2. I disagree that the thematic link is weak. Since 2006 (when DYK and OTD were swapped for this very reason), the right-hand column has highlighted — from top to bottom — our most polished articles and those for which polishing has just begun. The idea always has been to present both sides of the coin, acknowledging that Wikipedia is perpetually in development, with articles spanning the spectrum. The bottom placement of TAFI (linking to articles that the community is encouraged to <i>begin</i> polishing) is a logical expansion of this theme.</dd>
<dd><span class="inline-quote-talk2" style="font-style: italic; color: #008000;">Alternatively, how about putting in all ten of the the proposed articles and running it across both columns?</span></dd>
<dd>Even setting aside the aforementioned themes, it makes no sense to divide a single section in that manner. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 05:10, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<li>The last time we were trying to get the implementation for the TAFI done, it was me who got the CENT notice. But I do not have a clue as to where exactly do we need to be advertising. Can some experienced editor start the necessary centralised proposal/discussion/approval, and get it advertised at all the places it should be, including all the other sections on the main page? (I believe we missed the watchlist notice the last time around). Also, now we need some clear cut consensus as to how exactly things are supposed to go from here. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:45, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I like the minimalist approach (bare links with no blurbs). But we generally avoid the use of phrases like "<a href="Wikipedia_CLICKHERE" title="Wikipedia:CLICKHERE" class="mw-redirect">click here</a>", and any link that reloads a page should be labeled as such (to avoid surprising/confusing readers).

<dd>The section now contains even less text (greatly reducing the likelihood of it wrapping to a second line, as the previous verson did under my browser configuration), formatted to resemble other main page sections more closely. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 21:55, 8 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Well, the identical link in DYK works. But given the link to the complete list, there's no <i>need</i> to generate a new abbreviated set (an inferior solution that forces users to purge the page repeatedly — scrolling back down each time — before seeing all ten article links).</dd>
<dd>The randomization's intended purpose is simply to avoid encouraging too many users to edit a single article or small number of articles simultaneously. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 09:01, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>If that <i>isn't</i> the case, it should be trivially easy to have a bot purge the page at regular intervals, which surely would be much easier on the servers than it would be to encourage thousands of visitors per minute to do it (even given the small percentage that actually would). —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 09:26, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I personally also prefer a one line description of the article chosen, so anyone can understand what the article is about. (e.g. "A tomboy is a girl who dresses and acts like a boy.") This will be more along the lines of how the other sections have some caption or line about the articles involved. (There was certainly some agreement for the one-line description, though I am not sure if a consensus was formally established). <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:40, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>The process has been renamed "today's article<b>s</b> for improvement" (because multiple articles will be used at a given time), so it no longer makes sense to list only one (which would be quite confusing). But we can't list two or three <i>and</i> include an introductory message without exceeding the agreed-upon amount of text (resulting in its wrap under many more configurations). Likewise, descriptions greatly increased the section's size, prompting the above discussion. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 09:01, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I think it might be quite a controversial idea, but I wonder if DYK could be asked to limit themselves to 5 hooks. (AFAIK there was previously a system of 5 hooks in 3 queues everyday, which was changed to the current 7/8 in 2 per day. If there is consensus among the community as well as a general agreement in DYK, we might be able to reach some headway on this matter.) <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 11:37, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree with the notion of DYK going back to their previous system of "5 hooks in 3 queues" (as TheOriginalSoni says). It's essentially the same amount of articles so it's not like any more or less work must be done on their part. And that gives Tafi more lines to explain what it is, list the article(s), and provide a nice definition of what it is/they are. I never said this out loud, but I really did love those succinct definitions. A great way to get people hyped, and want to get into editing an article.--<a href="User_Coin945" title="User:Coin945">Coin945</a> (<a href="User_talk_Coin945" title="User talk:Coin945">talk</a>) 14:34, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I'm not sure where TheOriginalSoni got those numbers, but I can't recall the last time DYK used 5 hooks. At the moment, we're at 7 hooks 3 times a day, which is a total of 21 hooks per day, and we're just keeping even at the current rate and with a backlog of about 250 hooks under review. These days, DYK tends to cycle between 6 and 8 hooks per set and 2 and 4 sets per day, depending on the number of new and newly expanded articles that are submitted and reviewed. <a href="User_BlueMoonset" title="User:BlueMoonset">BlueMoonset</a> (<a href="User_talk_BlueMoonset" title="User talk:BlueMoonset">talk</a>) 16:39, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

Maybe I confused the number of DYK hooks I thought was ideal (five) with what it previously was (six).</dd>
<dd>Could there be consensus within DYK to reduce the number of hooks at any given time to 5 or 6? Those extra lines could be very useful for easily solving the question of formatting here. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 17:44, 9 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Yes, there is a backlog of hooks (currently 262), and yes, reducing the number of hooks will increase the backlog. As stated above, the current rate (21 per day) is keeping the backlog from growing, but not reducing it. I doubt there would be a consensus to reduce the number of hooks within DYK. I certainly would be opposed to it, and to losing the flexibility to change as the submission level waxes and wanes. <a href="User_BlueMoonset" title="User:BlueMoonset">BlueMoonset</a> (<a href="User_talk_BlueMoonset" title="User talk:BlueMoonset">talk</a>) 05:15, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>I agree. TAFI has to find its own space. It should not be stealing from other projects. I have suggested in the past, however that the DYK and ITN slots could be candidates for the addition of tabs (along the lines of my mockup <a href="User_Resolute/ProposalDYK" title="User:Resolute/ProposalDYK">here</a> from a previous proposal). Of course, the easiest solution to the TAFI unbalancing problem is to have it stand as a bar that runs across the entire width of the page, below both DYK and OTD. <a href="User_Resolute" title="User:Resolute">Reso</a><a href="User_talk_Resolute" title="User talk:Resolute">lute</a> 05:27, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>It isn't an exact science, but with a bit of effort, the setup currently in use on the main page enables us to keep the columns <i>more or less</i> balanced for most readers.</dd>
<dd>The TAFI draft currently appearing in the sandbox consumes a predictable (and fairly consistent, in terms of its impact on the two columns' balance) amount of space under a wide range of settings. Conversely, a short sentence will wrap for many users and <i>not</i> wrap for many others, so each one added to TAFI will increase the difficulty of maintaining column balance.</dd>

<dd>Note that DYK is the only section containing a basic description of its purpose ("from Wikipedia's newest content").

<dd>That's fair enough, but all the other sections have some sort of context drivers at the bottom of the sections, linking to the larger projects behind the content. The current version of TAFI is the only section that contains none of these links. I realize the section content is ultimately just a bunch of links, but there are no contextual links links to the feature itself, to show that it is a driven process, not random selections. I guess the "more selections" link is supposed to be the context driver. --<a href="User_NickPenguin" title="User:NickPenguin"><font color="darkgreen">Nick</font></a><a href="User_talk_NickPenguin" title="User talk:NickPenguin"><font color="darkblue">Penguin</font></a><sub>(<a href="Special_Contributions/NickPenguin" title="Special:Contributions/NickPenguin"><font color="blue"><b>contribs</b></font></a>)</sub> 02:33, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Oh, I agree that such a link is important. I should have been clearer in noting that the "More selections..." link's current destination is merely a temporary example lacking the full content that would be presented (including a suitable TAFI introduction/explanation). The link could even lead directly to <a href="Wikipedia_Today's_articles_for_improvement" title="Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement">Wikipedia:Today's articles for improvement</a>, provided that it's reworked a bit. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 03:41, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<li>I'm not sure what others prefer, but being a new section added, I think we should be giving a line of description such as <i>Help Wikipedia and join fellow editors in building _______ - one of Today's articles for improvement</i> under the TAFI section. If it is possible, we could also think of having the extra line of introduction along with the article, so it becomes more clear and concise to the readers what the article is about. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 06:49, 10 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>And I've mentioned that I did not understand how you <i>addressed</i> my points. For instance, I still do not see how no description and 3 links is more preferable version and in line with current Main Page sections. Your reply to the same makes no sense at all to the original statement. The second reply is more direct in what it approaches, but still fails to answer the main question behind it- Is it more preferable to be having multiple articles mainly because the project has been now renamed in the plural (Consensus, per se, was for a single article, but thats not a major issue), or to have a single article but with a succinct description, (like all other sections on the main page) so readers less confused on what "that word" means. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 23:05, 10 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>How hard is it to just try and explain what you said just once again!? Its really getting onto my nerves, the way you tangentially but categorically avoid the main question I try to ask.<br />
Just simply try to explain whatever you said once again, if possible, in more direct words. I do not see the point of what you said there. Which is why I am unable to understand it, which again is why I cannot pinpoint what the problem is. Because I see everything you said there to be incomprehensible.<br />
Seriously, if you're going to rephrase yourself, just do it. Otherwise just hat all the conversation that we had that went off-topic, and <i>let someone else answer my question/doubts</i>. I truly do not wish to continue this conversation, and get back to finalising TAFI for the main page. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 13:52, 11 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>I replied to your comments as plainly and directly as I know how to. You regard "everything [I] said there to be incomprehensible", and I sincerely don't know where the problem lies or how to rephrase my messages in a manner that would make them clearer. If you could be more specific, perhaps I'd gain a better understanding of where I've gone wrong. Conversely, responses to the effect of "None of what you said made any sense. Try again!" are unhelpful.<br />
Again, I'm genuinely sorry. I don't mean to mock you or evade your questions. I honestly don't know how to resolve this communication difficulty. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 14:25, 11 February 2013 (UTC)

<p>What's wrong with Resolute's suggestion (which I actually thought of independently although can't remember if I expressed) of "Of course, the easiest solution to the TAFI unbalancing problem is to have it stand as a bar that runs across the entire width of the page, below both DYK and OTD [and above - or maybe below - TFP]."?--<a href="User_Coin945" title="User:Coin945">Coin945</a> (<a href="User_talk_Coin945" title="User talk:Coin945">talk</a>) 11:44, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>It's a sensible idea, but it's inconsistent with the decision reached in the aforementioned discussion, so we'd need to establish consensus for a significantly different approach (an alternative layout requiring a larger amount of content to justify the use of a standalone, full-width box).</dd>
<dd>TAFI could appear six days per week, with TFL taking its place on Monday. (The TAFI selections are the same for a full week, so skipping Monday is preferable to cluttering it. And Monday happens to be the day on which the TAFI selections change, so that actually would provide a helpful opportunity for the project's members to switch over to the new set and make sure that everything is ready.) —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 14:18, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Stick to the formating of the TAFI (specific number of hooks and overall length/space) as approaved by consensus of the general community and place,as originally aproved, to the left and add an empty green header bar to the right with no text and no prose below. I recommend implementation of the "Today's Article For improvement" even <i>if</i> it has to be done by leaving an empty space in the lower righthand section. I trust the good faith and work of editors here, but the local consensus on this talkpage should not hold up the overall general community consensus to add TAFI to the main page. I know it needs to be done right, but it also may need to just be done - one way or another, with the understanding that the main page may need further adjusting.</p>
<p>I disagree that this needs to be held up until a solution is found, but I also feel I should provide a suggestion towards that solution anyway. The blank green bar is the most neutral manner of balancing the new addition on the left, but is it even needed? It could be left blank for now. Holding this up for the sake of balance is like saying it cannot be implemented until another new feature is decided on for the opposite side of the page. That won't happen, I'm sure, but....... there is another sister project to TAFI. we could look to the general community again to see if they would like to add <a href="Wikipedia_WikiProject_Editor_Retention/Editor_of_the_Week" title="Wikipedia:WikiProject Editor Retention/Editor of the Week">Wikipedia:WikiProject Editor Retention/Editor of the Week</a> to the right hand side column.

<p>Just to make sure, everyone here does realise that on any sized version of the main page other than at specific size parameters, the columns are not alligned, right? Every time i access the main page on my phone or itouch (when i want to edit, that is, not when i want to just view - I'll use the 'mobile' version for that), there are chunks of white space dangling at the bottom. And guess what? I don't care. I don't think anyone cares. Yes, it is nice if we can get both colomns to balance, but the fact of the matter is, it's pretty darn impossible, and i see no reason why they have to. They never used to have to until we make the decision to... oh i can't remember when it was. But the point is, I think this thing might be being enforced by people who are a touch <a href="Anal_retentiveness" title="Anal retentiveness">too anal</a>. I'll reiterate. On the whole noone cares. If we make the change, and get distressed letters from our fans..ermm..readers about how distraught they are over the patch of white emptiness that stares into their soul, then maybe we can do something about it. Secondly, this 'white space' occurs at the moment, on many platforms, and when you like your internet on a permanently scrolled in or out version. Therefore, I argue that this whole white space issue is white noise, and we should just get on with it. I'm not asking you to hold up the white flag, or trying to make this discussion go white hot...and that's not a white lie. (sorry.. i'm stuck on this colour phrase website at the moment...). The point is, that, yeah, I think we're ready to go up. A little white space never harmed anyone! (well, unless you swatted a fly with a blank sheet of paper.. in which case an A4 sized white space critically hurt a fly...&#160;:/).--<a href="User_Coin945" title="User:Coin945">Coin945</a> (<a href="User_talk_Coin945" title="User talk:Coin945">talk</a>) 07:10, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Admins (myself included) strive to minimize the white space as much as possible. As noted above, the longstanding layout enables us to keep the columns <i>more or less</i> balanced for most readers.</dd>
<dd>Indeed, people's settings vary greatly, so the balance will never be perfect or 100% consistent, but we generally manage to keep it within an acceptable range under most configurations. Inserting TAFI without compensating for its addition <i>would</i> worsen the balance. That won't happen (because admins <i>will</i> continue to compensate for imbalance), but when this discussion began, the version displayed in the sandbox would have caused significantly greater difficulty. —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 07:42, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Lets take a step back and look at our options for implementing the design discussed at the Village pump, where TAFI goes beneath DYK on the left hand side. Doing this generates too much blank space on the right hand side. As I see it, the only way to put TAFI on the left hand side is to do at least one of the following things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Decrease the space for Today's Featured Article</li>
<li>Decrease the space for Did You Know?</li>
<li>Increase the space for In The News</li>
<li>Increase the space for On This Day</li>
</ol>
<p>As far as I know, we have categorically eliminated option 2 because it would put DYK even further behind their backlog. And we have tentatively eliminated increasing ITN and OTD because there is not enough content to be viable in the long term. I am left with the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>We implement by decreasing space for Today's Featured Article</li>
<li>We add one item to each of ITN and OTD in the short term, and after TAFI matures with it's Main Page exposure, we reevaluate it's position in a month or two. This may coincide with the 2013 Main Page Redesign</li>
<li>We propose another method of implementation, such as a full page width bar, and seek consensus to implement TAFI in that manner. This would require another RFC which may or may not succeed.</li>
</ol>
<p>I know I might be creating a <a href="False_dilemma" title="False dilemma">false dilemma</a> here, but the only truly viable option I see is number two where ITN and OTD add one additional item. This is the simplest solution to get the implementation completed. <b>Note</b> Today's version of the Main Page (Feb 11th) doesn't have any whitespace problems at all with the <a href="Wikipedia_Main_Page/sandbox" title="Wikipedia:Main Page/sandbox">current implementation</a>. --<a href="User_NickPenguin" title="User:NickPenguin"><font color="darkgreen">Nick</font></a><a href="User_talk_NickPenguin" title="User talk:NickPenguin"><font color="darkblue">Penguin</font></a><sub>(<a href="Special_Contributions/NickPenguin" title="Special:Contributions/NickPenguin"><font color="blue"><b>contribs</b></font></a>)</sub> 03:03, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The mock-up at the beginning of this section created an imbalance that was very difficult to rectify within the current framework. This latest version is substantially easier to balance, requiring only about two additional blurbs between ITN and OTD.

<dd>Isn't the problem that there is too much of a backlog in DYK?

<dd>We did go over moving DYK to the right hand side and it was categorically eliminated. The left hand side is for featuring article type content, the right hand side for event type content. With the current structure in place, and the idea of changing it a significantly larger problem than is necessary to tackle with this problem, I suggest we leave it alone. TAFI fits into the category of content on the left, so it should go on the left</dd>
<dd>Anyways, getting back to things. I propose we do a more specific announcement with ITN and OTD, contact some people involved with the project and such, and let them know about the proposal to increase each item to one extra hook per day. If that is deemed an acceptable option, then I propose we do that and implement on the Main Page, it being the simplest method to accomplish that goal. --<a href="User_NickPenguin" title="User:NickPenguin"><font color="darkgreen">Nick</font></a><a href="User_talk_NickPenguin" title="User talk:NickPenguin"><font color="darkblue">Penguin</font></a><sub>(<a href="Special_Contributions/NickPenguin" title="Special:Contributions/NickPenguin"><font color="blue"><b>contribs</b></font></a>)</sub> 14:44, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>OTD is managed primarily by <a href="User_Howcheng" title="User:Howcheng">Howcheng</a>.

<li>From an ITN point of view, the spacing should not be an issue, as ITN doesn't have any fixed number of blurbs at all. ITN is generally the most flexible section, and blurbs will be removed, or old blurbs brought back, as needed to keep the main page balanced. It shouldn't affect the day-to-day functioning of ITN one iota, excepting that the oldest blurb is likely to be a day or two older than it currently is, but that's a small consideration. <a href="User_Howcheng" title="User:Howcheng">User:Howcheng</a> and anyone else that pitches in at OTD is likely in for a bit more work, as that has a set number of blurbs for each day, and rarely changes off of five; ensuring that OTD has an extra blurb each day is going to require a bit more extra work than ITN will need, which is negligible. --<a href="User_Jayron32" title="User:Jayron32"><font style="color:#000099">Jayron</font></a><i><b><a href="User_talk_Jayron32" title="User talk:Jayron32"><font style="color:#009900">32</font></a></b></i> 05:13, 12 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>OTD lists are updated annually, with some or all of the items rotated in and out. On all but a few dates (for which shortages of eligible articles exist), including an additional item requires virtually no extra work; one of the blurbs that would have been swapped out can simply be retained, with only a modicum of effort to ensure that it isn't topically similar to one of those being swapped in (something that already occurs). Alternatively, an additional blurb can be swapped in, but this isn't required.<br />
I'm prepared to assist in this area, in which I as fairly active in the past. (Until recently, the TFA blurbs were less consistent in length, so I sometimes expanded OTD to reduce the need to restore old ITN items.) —<a href="User_David_Levy" title="User:David Levy" class="mw-redirect">David Levy</a> 05:44, 12 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

If anything, Zambia is the country needing to be linked as it wasn't the subject of a revolution some 1-2 years ago and wasn't involved in an ouster of the then-President. <span style="font-family:trebuchet ms"><b><a href="../User_M.O.X" title="User:M.O.X"><span style="color:#003366">James</span></a> <sup>(<a href="../User_talk_M.O.X" title="User talk:M.O.X"><span style="color:#003366">T</span></a> • <a href="../Special_Contributions/M.O.X" title="Special:Contributions/M.O.X"><span style="color:#003366">C</span></a>)</sup> • 9:20pm</b> •</span> 10:20, 11 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Your assumption that its inclusion is based on some kind of puerile agenda is, honestly, a rather sweeping generalisation. Nudity hardly ever appears on the front page. Also, the argument "Think of the Children" is a contentious one, but the simple fact is that children do not view sexuality or nudity in the same way adults do. The chances of a child being harmed by that image? Almost certainly slim, and you only need a basic understanding of Child Psychology to know that.--<a href="User_Kawaii-Soft" title="User:Kawaii-Soft">Kawaii-Soft</a> (<a href="User_talk_Kawaii-Soft" title="User talk:Kawaii-Soft">talk</a>) 06:36, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Is this image supremely important to the history of photography? Would it be considered near to what David is to sculpturing? (not a rhetoric)</dd>
<dd><i>throughout the world</i> - I dont think so. Throughout the Western world? Possibly. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:14, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>It doesn't matter that it's not as important as David. Is that the cut-off point? No nude art that isn't Michaelangelo? Of course not. You're clutching at straws here. And actually you've been shown several non-Western examples too. <a href="User_Grapple_X" title="User:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>GRAPPLE</b></small></span></a> <a href="User_talk_Grapple_X" title="User talk:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>X</b></small></span></a> 07:15, 13 February 2013 (UTC)

<dd>Of course it does matter how important the image is! If it was that important, like say Liberty leading the People, I would be willing to agree that the image did hold significance enough to justify putting on the main page. But this image is NOT that important in the history of photography. If it is, do correct me, and I shall take back <i>all</i> my statements.</dd>
<dd>And nopes. None of the examples have been outside the first world countries, or in any of the countries I have mentioned. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:20, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Changing your criteria after asking for something is in poor form but if you look up I've <i>still</i> met them. And I have already stated that <i>yes</i> the image is important, but not as important as the most famous sculpture of the past millennium. It is an important benchmark in its medium and to set another medium's high-water-mark as the standard is just lunacy. <a href="User_Grapple_X" title="User:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>GRAPPLE</b></small></span></a> <a href="User_talk_Grapple_X" title="User talk:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>X</b></small></span></a> 07:27, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Do you mind showing sources as to what exactly you are saying? I would like to see how the history of photography would not be complete without <i>this</i> particular image. <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:31, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, why this image could not have been adequately replaced by another non-nude image of similar stature. (Stature wrt what the reason is for including this image from a historical perspective) <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:32, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Are you not actually paying attention here or something? "t illustrates an early step in the progress of photography, especially colour photography". At <i>absolutely no point</i> was it said that "the history of photography would not be complete" without this image. Stop putting words in editors' mouths, stop moving your goalposts, go grow up. <a href="User_Grapple_X" title="User:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>GRAPPLE</b></small></span></a> <a href="User_talk_Grapple_X" title="User talk:Grapple X"><span style="color:#556655"><small><b>X</b></small></span></a> 07:33, 13 February 2013 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>Do you mind leaving statements like "Grow up" out of your responses? I just wish to know how important this image is wrt early photography. If it was something like the first image to be taken in a particular medium or something, then that might be justification enough to add this image. But was there no other image which could have served our purpose <i>without</i> showing nudity? <a href="User_TheOriginalSoni" title="User:TheOriginalSoni">TheOriginalSoni</a> (<a href="User_talk_TheOriginalSoni" title="User talk:TheOriginalSoni">talk</a>) 07:39, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>
