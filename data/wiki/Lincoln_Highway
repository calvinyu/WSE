<p>The <b>Lincoln Highway</b> is one of the first transcontinental highways for automobiles across the United States of America.<sup id="cite_ref-FHWA-LH_1-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-FHWA-LH-1"><span>[</span>1<span>]</span></a></sup> The highway turns 100 years old in 2013.</p>
<p>Conceived and promoted by <a href="Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a> entrepreneur <a href="../Carl_G._Fisher" title="Carl G. Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a>, the Lincoln Highway spans coast-to-coast from <a href="Times_Square" title="Times Square">Times Square</a> in New York City to <a href="Lincoln_Park_(San_Francisco)" title="Lincoln Park (San Francisco)">Lincoln Park</a> in San Francisco, originally through 13 states: <a href="New_York" title="New York">New York</a>, <a href="New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a>, <a href="Pennsylvania" title="Pennsylvania">Pennsylvania</a>, <a href="Ohio" title="Ohio">Ohio</a>, <a href="Indiana" title="Indiana">Indiana</a>, <a href="Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>, <a href="Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a>, <a href="Nebraska" title="Nebraska">Nebraska</a>, <a href="Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a>, <a href="Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, <a href="Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a>, and <a href="California" title="California">California</a>. In 1915, the "Colorado Loop" was removed, and in 1928, a realignment relocated the Lincoln Highway through the northern tip of <a href="West_Virginia" title="West Virginia">West Virginia</a>. Thus, there are a total of 14 states, 128 counties, and over 700 cities, towns and villages through which the highway passes at some time in its history.</p>
<p>The first officially recorded length of the entire Lincoln Highway in 1913 was 3,389 miles (5,454&#160;km).<sup id="cite_ref-3" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-3"><span>[</span>a<span>]</span></a></sup> Over the years, the road was improved and numerous realignments were made, and by 1924 the highway had been shortened to 3,142 miles (5,057&#160;km). Counting the original route and all of the subsequent realignments, there is a grand total of 5,869 miles (9,445&#160;km).<sup id="cite_ref-4" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-4"><span>[</span>3<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Conceived in 1912 and formally dedicated October 31, 1913, the Lincoln Highway is America's first national memorial to President <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>, predating the 1922 dedication of the <a href="Lincoln_Memorial" title="Lincoln Memorial">Lincoln Memorial</a> in Washington, D.C. by nine years. As the first automobile road across America, the Lincoln Highway brought great prosperity to the hundreds of cities, towns and villages along the way. The Lincoln Highway became affectionately known as "The Main Street Across America."</p>
<p>The Lincoln Highway was inspired by the <a href="Good_Roads_Movement" title="Good Roads Movement">Good Roads Movement</a>. In turn, the success of the Lincoln Highway and the resulting economic boost to the governments, businesses and citizens along its route inspired the creation of many other named long-distance roads (known as <a href="Auto_trail" title="Auto trail">National Auto Trails</a>), such as the <a href="Yellowstone_Trail" title="Yellowstone Trail">Yellowstone Trail</a>, <a href="National_Old_Trails_Road" title="National Old Trails Road">National Old Trails Road</a>, <a href="Dixie_Highway" title="Dixie Highway">Dixie Highway</a>, <a href="Jefferson_Highway" title="Jefferson Highway">Jefferson Highway</a>, <a href="Bankhead_Highway" title="Bankhead Highway">Bankhead Highway</a>, <a href="Jackson_Highway" title="Jackson Highway">Jackson Highway</a>, <a href="Meridian_Highway" title="Meridian Highway">Meridian Highway</a> and <a href="Victory_Highway" title="Victory Highway">Victory Highway</a>. Many of these named highways were supplanted by the <a href="United_States_Numbered_Highways" title="United States Numbered Highways">United States Numbered Highways</a> system of 1926. Most of the 1928 Lincoln Highway route became <a href="US_Route_30" title="US Route 30" class="mw-redirect">US Route 30</a>, with portions becoming <a href="US_Route_1" title="US Route 1" class="mw-redirect">US Route 1</a> in the East and <a href="US_Route_40" title="US Route 40" class="mw-redirect">US Route 40</a> and <a href="US_Route_50" title="US Route 50" class="mw-redirect">US Route 50</a> in the West. Since 1928, many sections of U.S. Route 30 have been re-aligned with new bypasses; therefore, today's U.S. Route 30 aligns with less than 25% of the original 1913-1928 Lincoln Highway routes.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the Lincoln Highway inspired the <a href="National_Interstate_and_Defense_Highways_Act_of_1956" title="National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956" class="mw-redirect">National Interstate and Defense Highways Act of 1956</a>, which was championed by <a href="President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> <a href="../Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight D. Eisenhower</a>, influenced by his experiences as a young soldier crossing the country in the <a href="Transcontinental_Motor_Convoy" title="Transcontinental Motor Convoy">1919 Army Convoy</a> on the Lincoln Highway. Today, <a href="Interstate_80" title="Interstate 80">Interstate 80</a> is the cross-country highway most closely aligned with the Lincoln Highway. In the West, particularly in Wyoming, Utah and California, sections of Interstate 80 are paved directly over alignments of the Lincoln Highway.</p>
<p>The <i>Lincoln Highway Association</i>, originally established in 1913 to plan, promote, and sign the highway, was re-formed in 1992 and is now dedicated to promoting and preserving the road. The LHA has 1000 members located in 40 states and Washington D.C., and in Canada, England, Germany, Luxembourg, Scotland and Norway. The association has active state chapters in 12 Lincoln Highway states and maintains a national tourist center in <a href="Franklin_Grove,_Illinois" title="Franklin Grove, Illinois">Franklin Grove, Illinois</a>, in a historic building built by Harry Isaac Lincoln, a cousin of <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. The LHA holds yearly national conferences, and is governed by a board of directors with representatives from each Lincoln Highway state.<sup id="cite_ref-5" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-5"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>In 2013, the Lincoln Highway Association will host the Official Lincoln Highway 100th Anniversary Tours and Centennial Celebration. The two tours will start simultaneously the last week of June 2013 in New York City and San Francisco, and take one week to reach the midpoint of the Lincoln Highway in Kearney, Nebraska, where the centennial celebration will be hosted at the Great Platte River Road Museum on July 1, 2013.</p>

<p>In 1912, railroads dominated interstate transportation in America, and roadways were primarily of local interest. Outside cities, "market roads" were sometimes maintained by counties or townships, but maintenance of rural roads fell to those who lived along them. Many states had constitutional prohibitions against funding "internal improvements" such as road projects, and federal highway programs were not to become effective until 1921.</p>
<p>At the time, the country had about 2.2&#160;million miles (3.5&#160;million km) of rural roads, of which a mere 8.66 percent (190,476 miles or 306,541&#160;km) had "improved" surfaces: gravel, stone, sand-clay, brick, shells, oiled earth, etc. Interstate roads were considered a luxury, something only for wealthy travelers who could spend weeks riding around in their automobiles.</p>
<p>Support for a system of improved interstate highways had been growing. For example, The <i><a href="New_York_Times" title="New York Times" class="mw-redirect">New York Times</a></i> in an article on August 27, 1911, gave quotes from several prominent men. "Of the Nation's leaders," it said, "none is more emphatic than Speaker <a href="Champ_Clark" title="Champ Clark">Champ Clark</a>." Furthermore, from a communication to President Robert P. Hooper of the American Automobile Association, the article quoted Clark's opinion that, "I believe the time has come for the general Government to actively and powerfully co-operate with the States in building a great system of public highways...that would bring its benefits to every citizen in the country." However, Congress as a whole was not yet ready to commit funding to such projects.</p>

</div>
</div>
<p><a href="../Carl_G._Fisher" title="Carl G. Fisher">Carl G. Fisher</a> was an early automobile entrepreneur who was the manufacturer of <a href="Prest-O-Lite" title="Prest-O-Lite" class="mw-redirect">Prest-O-Lite</a> compressed carbide-gas headlights used on most early cars, and was also one of the principal investors who built the <a href="Indianapolis_Motor_Speedway" title="Indianapolis Motor Speedway">Indianapolis Motor Speedway</a>. He believed that the popularity of automobiles was dependent on good roads. In 1912 he began promoting his dream of a transcontinental highway, and at a September 10 dinner meeting with industry friends in <a href="Indianapolis" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a>, he called for a coast-to-coast rock highway to be completed by May 1, 1915, in time for the <a href="Panama-Pacific_International_Exposition" title="Panama-Pacific International Exposition" class="mw-redirect">Panama-Pacific International Exposition</a> in San Francisco.<sup id="cite_ref-7" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-7"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> He estimated the cost at about $10&#160;million and told the group, "Let's build it before we're too old to enjoy it!"<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from September 2008">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> Within a month Fisher's friends had pledged $1&#160;million. <a href="Henry_Ford" title="Henry Ford">Henry Ford</a>, the biggest automaker of his day, refused to contribute because he believed the government should build America's roads. However, contributors included former U.S. President <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="../Thomas_A._Edison" title="Thomas A. Edison" class="mw-redirect">Thomas A. Edison</a>, both friends of Fisher, as well as then-current President <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, the first U.S. President to make frequent use of an automobile for relaxation.</p>
<p>Fisher and his associates chose a name for the road, naming it after one of Fisher's heroes, <a href="Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">Abraham Lincoln</a>. At first they had to consider other names,<sup id="cite_ref-AHM_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AHM-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup> such as "The Coast-to-Coast Rock Highway" or "The Ocean-to-Ocean Highway," because the Lincoln Highway name had been reserved earlier by a group of Easterners who were seeking support to build their Lincoln Highway from Washington to Gettysburg on federal funds. When Congress turned down their proposed appropriation, the project collapsed, and Fisher's preferred name became readily available.</p>
<p>On July 1, 1913, the <a href="Lincoln_Highway_Association" title="Lincoln Highway Association" class="mw-redirect">Lincoln Highway Association</a> (LHA) was established "to procure the establishment of a continuous improved highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific, open to lawful traffic of all description without toll charges." The first goal of the LHA was to build the rock highway from <a href="Times_Square" title="Times Square">Times Square</a> in New York City to <a href="Lincoln_Park_(San_Francisco)" title="Lincoln Park (San Francisco)">Lincoln Park</a> in San Francisco. The second goal was to promote the Lincoln Highway as an example to, in Fisher's words, "stimulate as nothing else could the building of enduring highways everywhere that will not only be a credit to the American people but that will also mean much to American agriculture and American commerce." <a href="Henry_Bourne_Joy" title="Henry Bourne Joy">Henry Joy</a> was named as the LHA president, so that although Carl Fisher remained a driving force in furthering the goals of the association, it would not appear as his one-man crusade.<sup id="cite_ref-AHM_8-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-AHM-8"><span>[</span>7<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>The LHA needed to determine the best and most direct route from New York City to San Francisco. East of the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, route selection was eased by the relatively dense road network. To scout a western route, the LHA's "Trail-Blazer" tour set out from <a href="Indianapolis" title="Indianapolis">Indianapolis</a> in 17 cars and 2 trucks on July 1, 1913, the same day LHA headquarters were established in Detroit. After 34 days of <a href="Iowa" title="Iowa">Iowa</a> mud pits, sand drifts in <a href="Nevada" title="Nevada">Nevada</a> and <a href="Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>, overheated <a href="Radiator_(engine_cooling)" title="Radiator (engine cooling)">radiators</a>, flooded roads, cracked axles, and enthusiastic greetings in every town that thought it had a chance of being on the new highway, the tour arrived for a parade down San Francisco's <a href="Market_Street_(San_Francisco,_California)" title="Market Street (San Francisco, California)" class="mw-redirect">Market Street</a> before thousands of cheering residents.</p>
<p>The Trail-Blazers returned to Indianapolis by train, and a few weeks later on September 14, 1913 the route was announced. LHA leaders, particularly <a href="Packard_Motor_Car_Company" title="Packard Motor Car Company" class="mw-redirect">Packard</a> president <a href="Henry_Bourne_Joy" title="Henry Bourne Joy">Henry Joy</a>, wanted as straight a route as possible and the 3,389 miles (5,454&#160;km) route announced did not necessarily follow the course of the Trail-Blazers. There were many disappointed town officials, particularly in <a href="Colorado" title="Colorado">Colorado</a> and <a href="Kansas" title="Kansas">Kansas</a>, who had greeted the Trail-Blazers and thought the tour's passage had meant their towns would be on the Highway.</p>
<p>Less than half the selected route was improved roadway. As segments were improved over time, the route length was reduced by about 250 miles (400&#160;km). Several segments of the Lincoln Highway route followed historic roads:</p>
<ul>
<li>a road laid out by Dutch colonists of <a href="New_Jersey" title="New Jersey">New Jersey</a> before 1675</li>
<li>the 1796 <a href="Lancaster_Turnpike" title="Lancaster Turnpike" class="mw-redirect">Lancaster Turnpike</a> in Pennsylvania</li>

</ul>
<p>The LHA dedicated the route on October 31, 1913. Bonfires, fireworks, concerts, parades, and street dances were held in hundreds of cities in the 13 states along the route. During a dedication ceremony in Iowa, State Engineer Thomas H. MacDonald said he felt it was "...the first outlet for the road building energies of this community." He went on to advocate the creation of a system of transcontinental highways with radial routes. In 1919, MacDonald became Commissioner of the <a href="Bureau_of_Public_Roads" title="Bureau of Public Roads" class="mw-redirect">Bureau of Public Roads</a> (BPR), a post he held until 1953, when he oversaw the early stages of the <a href="Interstate_Highway" title="Interstate Highway" class="mw-redirect">Dwight D. Eisenhower System of Interstate and Defense Highways</a>.</p>

<p>In September 1912, in a letter to a friend, Fisher wrote that "...the highways of America are built chiefly of politics, whereas the proper material is crushed rock, or concrete." The leaders of the LHA were masters of the <a href="Public_relations" title="Public relations">public relations</a>, and used publicity and propaganda as even more important materials.</p>
<p>In the early days of the effort, each contribution from a famous supporter was publicized. <a href="Theodore_Roosevelt" title="Theodore Roosevelt">Theodore Roosevelt</a> and <a href="Thomas_Edison" title="Thomas Edison">Thomas Edison</a>, both friends of Fisher, sent checks. A friendly Member of <a href="United_States_Congress" title="United States Congress">Congress</a> arranged for a dedicated motor enthusiast, President <a href="Woodrow_Wilson" title="Woodrow Wilson">Woodrow Wilson</a>, to contribute US$5 whereupon he was issued Highway Certificate #1. Copies of the certificate were promptly distributed to the press.</p>
<p>One of the best known contributions came from a small group of <a href="Eskimo" title="Eskimo">Esquimaux</a> children in Anvik, <a href="Alaska" title="Alaska">Alaska</a>. Their American teacher told them about Abraham Lincoln and the highway to be built in his honor, and they took up a collection and sent it to the LHA with the note, "Fourteen pennies from Anvik Esquimaux children for the Lincoln Highway." The LHA distributed pictures of the coins and the accompanying letter, and both were widely reprinted.</p>
<p>One of Fisher's first acts after opening LHA headquarters was to hire F. T. Grenell, city editor of the <a href="Detroit_Free_Press" title="Detroit Free Press">Detroit Free Press</a>, as a part-time publicity man. The Trail-Blazer tour included representatives of the <a href="Hearst_Corporation" title="Hearst Corporation">Hearst newspaper syndicate</a>, the <i><a href="The_Indianapolis_Star" title="The Indianapolis Star">Indianapolis Star and News</a></i>, the <i><a href="Chicago_Tribune" title="Chicago Tribune">Chicago Tribune</a></i>, and telegraph companies to help transmit their dispatches.</p>
<p>In preparation for the October 31 dedication ceremonies, the LHA asked clergy across the United States to discuss Abraham Lincoln in their sermons on November 2, the Sunday nearest the dedication. The LHA then distributed copies of many of the sermons, such as one by <a href="James_Gibbons" title="James Gibbons">Cardinal Gibbons</a> who, with the dedication fresh in mind, had written that "such a highway will be a most fitting and useful monument to the memory of Lincoln."</p>
<p>One of the greater contributions to highway development was a well-publicized and promoted <a href="United_States_Army" title="United States Army">U.S. Army</a> <a href="Transcontinental_Motor_Convoy" title="Transcontinental Motor Convoy">Transcontinental Motor Convoy</a> in 1919. The convoy left the <a href="White_House" title="White House">White House</a> in Washington, D.C. on July 7, 1919, and met the Lincoln Highway route at <a href="Gettysburg,_Pennsylvania" title="Gettysburg, Pennsylvania">Gettysburg, Pennsylvania</a>. After two months of travel, the convoy reached San Francisco on September 6, 1919. Though bridges failed, vehicles broke and were sometimes stuck in mud, the convoy was greeted in communities across the country. The LHA used the convoy's difficulties to show the need for better main highways, building popular support for both local and federal funding. The convoy led to the passage of many county bond issues supporting highway construction.</p>
<p>One of the participants in the convoy was a young <a href="Lieutenant_Colonel_(United_States)" title="Lieutenant Colonel (United States)" class="mw-redirect">Lt.Col.</a> <a href="../Dwight_D._Eisenhower" title="Dwight D. Eisenhower">Dwight Eisenhower</a>, and it was so memorable that he devoted a chapter to it ("Through Darkest America With Truck and Tank") in his 1967 book <i>At Ease: Stories I Tell to Friends</i>. That 1919 experience, and his exposure to the <a href="Autobahn" title="Autobahn" class="mw-redirect">autobahn</a> network in Germany in the 1940s, found expression in 1954 when he announced his "Grand Plan" for highways. The resulting <a href="Federal-Aid_Highway_Act_of_1956" title="Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1956" class="mw-redirect">1956 legislation</a> created the Highway Trust Fund that accelerated construction of the <a href="Interstate_Highway_System" title="Interstate Highway System">Interstate Highway System</a>.</p>
<p>Fisher's idea that the auto industry and private contributions could pay for the highway was soon abandoned, and, while the LHA did help finance a few short sections of roadway, LHA founders' and members' contributions were used primarily for publicity and promotion to encourage travel on the Highway and to lobby officials at all levels to support its construction by governments.</p>
<h3><span class="editsection">[<a href="../../w/index-title=Lincoln_Highway&action=edit&section=7.php.html" title="Edit section: Early travel">edit</a>]</span> <span class="mw-headline" id="Early_travel">Early travel</span></h3>
<p>According to the Association's 1916 <i>Official Road Guide</i> a trip from the Atlantic to the Pacific on the Lincoln Highway was "something of a sporting proposition" and might take 20 to 30 days. To make it in 30 days the motorist would need to average 18 miles (29&#160;km) an hour for 6 hours per day, and driving was only done during daylight hours. The trip was thought to cost no more than $5 a day per person, including food, gas, oil, and even "five or six meals in hotels." Car repairs would, of course, increase the cost.</p>
<p>Since gasoline stations were still rare in many parts of the country, motorists were urged to top off their gasoline at every opportunity, even if they had done so recently. Motorists should wade through water before driving through to verify the depth. The list of recommended equipment included chains, a shovel, axe, jacks, tire casings and inner tubes, tools, and (of course) a pair of Lincoln Highway pennants. And, the guide offered this sage advice: "Don't wear new shoes."</p>
<p>Firearms were not necessary, but west of Omaha full camping equipment was recommended, and the guide warned against drinking alkali water that could cause serious cramps. In certain areas, advice was offered on getting help, for example near <a href="Fish_Springs,_Utah" title="Fish Springs, Utah" class="mw-redirect">Fish Springs, Utah</a>, "If trouble is experienced, build a sagebrush fire. Mr. Thomas will come with a team. He can see you 20 miles off." Later editions omitted Mr. Thomas, but westbound travelers were advised to stop at the Orr's Ranch for advice, and eastbound motorists were to check with Mr. K.C. Davis of Gold Hill, Nevada.</p>

<p>While the Lincoln Highway Association did not have sufficient funds to sponsor large sections of the road, starting in 1914 it did sponsor "Seedling Mile" projects. According to the 1924 LHA Guide the Seedling Miles were intended "to demonstrate the desirability of this permanent type of road construction" to rally public support for government-backed construction. The LHA convinced industry of their self-interest and was able to arrange donations of materials from the <a href="Portland_cement" title="Portland cement">Portland Cement</a> Association.<sup id="cite_ref-14" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-14"><span>[</span>13<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>The first Seedling Mile was built in 1914 west of <a href="Malta,_Illinois" title="Malta, Illinois">Malta</a>, Illinois, but after years of experience the LHA began a design effort for a road section that could handle traffic 20 years into the future. Seventeen highway experts met between December 1920 and February 1921, and specified:</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<ul>
<li>a right-of-way 110 feet (34&#160;m) in width</li>
<li>a concrete road bed 40 feet (12&#160;m) wide and 10 inches (254&#160;mm) thick to support loads of 8,000 pounds (3,600&#160;kg) per wheel</li>
<li>curves with a minimum radius of 1,000 feet (300&#160;m), banked for 35&#160;mph (56&#160;km/h), with <a href="Guard_rail" title="Guard rail">guard rails</a> at embankments</li>
<li>no grade crossings or advertising signs</li>
<li>a footpath for pedestrians</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>The most famous Seedling Mile built to these specifications was the 1.3-mile (2.1&#160;km) "Ideal Section" between <a href="Dyer,_Indiana" title="Dyer, Indiana">Dyer</a> and <a href="Schererville,_Indiana" title="Schererville, Indiana">Schererville</a> in <a href="Lake_County,_Indiana" title="Lake County, Indiana">Lake County</a>, Indiana. With federal, state, and county funds, and a US$130,000 contribution by <a href="United_States_Rubber_Company" title="United States Rubber Company">United States Rubber Company</a> president and LHA founder C.B. Seger, the Ideal Section was built during 1922 and 1923. Magazines and newspapers called the Ideal Section a vision of the future, and highway officials from across the country visited and wrote technical papers that circulated both in the United States and overseas. The Ideal Section is still in use to this day, and has worn so well that a driver would not notice it unless the marker near the road brought it to their attention.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from January 2010">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup></p>

<p>By the mid-1920s there were about 250 <a href="National_auto_trail" title="National auto trail" class="mw-redirect">National auto trails</a>. Some were major routes, such as the Lincoln Highway, the <a href="Jefferson_Highway" title="Jefferson Highway">Jefferson Highway</a>, the <a href="National_Old_Trails_Highway" title="National Old Trails Highway" class="mw-redirect">National Old Trails Road</a>, the <a href="Old_Spanish_Trail_(auto_trail)" title="Old Spanish Trail (auto trail)">Old Spanish Trail</a>, and the <a href="Yellowstone_Trail" title="Yellowstone Trail">Yellowstone Trail</a>, but most were shorter. Some of the shorter routes were formed more to generate revenues for a <a href="../../w/index-title=Trail_association&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Trail association (page does not exist)">trail association</a> rather than for their value as a route between significant locations.</p>
<p>By 1925 governments had joined the roadbuilding movement, and began to assert control. Federal and state officials established the Joint Board on Interstate Highways, which proposed a numbered <a href="../U.S._Highway_system" title="U.S. Highway system" class="mw-redirect">U.S. Highway system</a> which would make the Trail designations obsolete, though technically the Joint Board had no authority over highway names. Increasing government support for roadbuilding was making the old road associations less important, but the LHA still had significant influence. The Secretary of the Joint Board, BPR official E. W. James, went to Detroit to gain LHA support for the numbering scheme, knowing it would be hard for smaller road associations to object if the LHA publicly supported the new plan.</p>
<p>The LHA preferred numbering the existing named routes, but in the end the LHA was more interested in the larger plan for roadbuilding than they were in officially retaining the name. They knew the Lincoln Highway name was fixed in the mind of the public, and James promised them that, so far as possible, the Lincoln Highway would have the number 30 for its entire route. An editorial in the February 1926 issue of <i>The Lincoln Forum</i> reflected the outcome:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">The Lincoln Highway Association would have liked to have seen the Lincoln Highway designated as a United States route entirely across the continent and designated by a single numeral throughout its length. But it realized that this was only a sentimental consideration. ... The Lincoln Way is too firmly established upon the map of the United States and in the minds and hearts of the people as a great, useful and everlasting memorial to Abraham Lincoln to warrant any skepticism as to the attitude of those States crossed by the route. Those universally familiar red, white and blue markers, in many states the first to be erected on any thru route, will never lose their significance or their place on America's first transcontinental road.</div>
</blockquote>
<p>The states approved the new federal numbering system in November 1926 and began putting up new signs. The Lincoln Highway was not alone in being split among several numbers, but the entire routing between Philadelphia and Granger, Wyoming, was assigned "U.S. 30" per the agreement. East of Philadelphia the Lincoln Highway was part of U.S. 1, and west of Salt Lake City the route became U.S. 40 across Donner Pass. Only the segment between Granger and Salt Lake City was not part of the new numbering plan; U.S. 30 was assigned to a more northerly route toward Pocatello, Idaho. When U.S. 50 was extended to California it followed the Lincoln Highway's alternate route south of Lake Tahoe.</p>
<p>The last major promotional activity of the LHA took place on September 1, 1928, when at 1:00&#160;p.m. groups of <a href="Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scouts</a> placed approximately 2,400 <a href="Scouting_memorials" title="Scouting memorials" class="mw-redirect">concrete markers</a> at sites along the route to officially mark and dedicate it to the memory of Abraham Lincoln. Less commonly known is that 4,000 metal signs for urban areas were also erected then.<sup id="cite_ref-16" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-16"><span>[</span>b<span>]</span></a></sup> <i>The markers were placed on the outer edge of the right of way at major and minor crossroads, and at reassuring intervals along uninterrupted segments. Each concrete post carried the Lincoln Highway insignia and directional arrow, and a bronze medallion with Lincoln's bust and stating "This Highway Dedicated to Abraham Lincoln".</i></p>
<p>The Lincoln Highway was not yet the imagined "rock highway" from coast to coast when the LHA ceased operating, as there were many segments that had still not been paved. Some parts were because of reroutings, such as a dispute in the early 1920s with Utah officials that forced the LHA to change routes in western Utah and eastern Nevada. Construction was underway on the final unpaved 42-mile (68&#160;km) segment by the 25th anniversary of the Lincoln Highway in 1938.</p>

<p>On June 8, 1938, President <a href="../Franklin_D._Roosevelt" title="Franklin D. Roosevelt">Franklin D. Roosevelt</a> signed the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1938, which called for a BPR report on the feasibility of a system of transcontinental toll roads. The "Toll Roads and Free Roads" report was the first official step toward creation of the Interstate Highway System in the United States.</p>
<p>The 25th Anniversary of the Lincoln Highway was noted a month later in a July 3, 1938, nationwide radio broadcast on <a href="NBC_Radio" title="NBC Radio" class="mw-redirect">NBC</a>. The program featured interviews with a number of LHA officials, and a message from Carl Fisher read by an announcer in Detroit. Fisher's statement included:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">The Lincoln Highway Association has accomplished its primary purpose, that of providing an object lesson to show the possibility in highway transportation and the importance of a unified, safe, and economical system of roads. ... Now I believe the country is at the beginning of another new era in highway building (that will) create a system of roads far beyond the dreams of the Lincoln Highway founders. I hope this anniversary observance makes millions of people realize how vital roads are to our national welfare, to economic programs, and to our national defense...</div>

<p>Fisher died about a year after the 25th Anniversary in 1940, having lost most of his fortune. In the many years since, the Lincoln Highway has remained a persistent memory:</p>

<li>Some segments of U.S. 30 still carry the name.</li>
<li>Some city streets on which the Lincoln Highway was routed still carry the street name "Lincoln Way" or "Lincolnway", including: <a href="Mishawaka,_Indiana" title="Mishawaka, Indiana">Mishawaka, Indiana</a>; <a href="Valparaiso,_Indiana" title="Valparaiso, Indiana">Valparaiso, Indiana</a>; <a href="Aurora,_Illinois" title="Aurora, Illinois">Aurora, Illinois</a>; <a href="DeKalb,_Illinois" title="DeKalb, Illinois">DeKalb, Illinois</a>; <a href="Ames,_Iowa" title="Ames, Iowa">Ames, Iowa</a>; <a href="Cheyenne,_Wyoming" title="Cheyenne, Wyoming">Cheyenne, Wyoming</a>; <a href="Sparks,_Nevada" title="Sparks, Nevada">Sparks, Nevada</a>; <a href="Auburn,_California" title="Auburn, California">Auburn, California</a>; and <a href="Galt,_California" title="Galt, California">Galt, California</a>. <i>(Note: President Lincoln was popular, and many cities named streets after him, so not every "Lincoln Way" is in fact the Lincoln Highway. Two examples in San Francisco are Lincoln Way along the south side of <a href="Golden_Gate_Park" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, and Lincoln Boulevard in the <a href="Presidio_of_San_Francisco" title="Presidio of San Francisco">Presidio</a>, neither of which were ever the Lincoln Highway.)</i></li>
<li>Old Lincoln Highway is a secondary street in <a href="Trevose,_Pennsylvania" title="Trevose, Pennsylvania">Trevose, Pennsylvania</a>, using the old highway alignment.</li>
<li>A few of the 3,000 Boy Scout markers can be found along the old route. In some communities, these are being re-established in cooperation with the LHA, such as West Sacramento and Davis, California.</li>
<li>A <a href="Lincoln_Highway_(Omaha)" title="Lincoln Highway (Omaha)">stretch near Omaha, Nebraska</a> paved with original brick has been preserved by the city government.</li>
<li>A bridge with railings spelling out "LINCOLN HIGHWAY" remains in use as part of County Road E66 in <a href="Tama_County,_Iowa" title="Tama County, Iowa">Tama County, Iowa</a>.</li>
<li>Restaurants, motels, and gas stations in many locations still carry Lincoln-related names.</li>

Joy, the first president of the LHA, with an inscription describing Joy as one "who saw realized the dream of a continuous improved highway from the Atlantic to the Pacific." Not far from the memorial along I-80 a motorist could see an abandoned stretch of the Lincoln Highway with weeds growing through cracks in the pavement. In 2001, this monument was relocated to a place on I-80 midway between <a href="Cheyenne,_Wyoming" title="Cheyenne, Wyoming">Cheyenne</a> and <a href="Laramie,_Wyoming" title="Laramie, Wyoming">Laramie</a>.</li>
<li>At the rest area of exit 323 on I-80 east of <a href="Laramie,_Wyoming" title="Laramie, Wyoming">Laramie</a>, is the highest point on I-80. Located there is a thirteen and a half foot bronze bust of Lincoln. It is mounted on a massive, thirty-five foot granite base. The monument was created in 1959 to mark the high point of the Lincoln Highway and it originally stood about half a mile west and 200 feet (61&#160;m) higher along U.S. RT. 30 which closely followed the path of the Lincoln Highway across this summit. It was moved to the present location in 1969 after I-80 was opened. <a href="Robert_Russin" title="Robert Russin">Robert Russin</a>, an art professor at the <a href="University_of_Wyoming" title="University of Wyoming">University of Wyoming</a> created this stern, brooding sculpture.

The group was met by LHA chapters, car clubs, local tourism groups and community leaders throughout the route. Several Boy Scout troops along the way held ceremonies to commemorate the 75th Anniversary of the nationwide LH route marker post erection of September 1, 1928. When the tour concluded at Lincoln Park, in front of the <a href="Palace_of_the_Legion_of_Honor" title="Palace of the Legion of Honor" class="mw-redirect">Palace of the Legion of Honor</a> in San Francisco, another ceremony was held to honor both the 90th Anniversary of the road and the 75th anniversary of the post erections.</p>

<p>Old Lincoln Highway,<sup id="cite_ref-SearchInQuotes_18-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-SearchInQuotes-18"><span>[</span>16<span>]</span></a></sup> and sometimes Old Route 30 and Old U.S. 30, are terms both colloquially and officially applied to bypassed parts of the Lincoln Highway.</p>
<p>Such roadways are essentially the older first established parts of <a href="../U.S._Route_30" title="U.S. Route 30">U.S. Route 30</a> (1913) west of New York City and east of San Francisco through areas which grew, and so grew in their need for modern multilane highways. Terms such as the <i>'Old Lincoln Highway'</i> and <i>'Old Lincoln Road'</i> are similar terms frequently built into the local business structure as official addresses, so are now embedded in the U.S. culture such as in advertising and literature. These extensive renamings generally refer to older roadway parts (passing through congested business or residential neighborhoods) which have been replaced by newer, more convenient highways or in most cases modern multilane <a href="Super-highway" title="Super-highway" class="mw-redirect">super-highways</a>. A few places stubbornly kept the original Lincoln Highway title, but on a renumbered highway letting the <a href="United_States_Department_of_Transportation" title="United States Department of Transportation">U.S. Dept. of Transportation</a> keep the designated <a href="../U.S._Route_30" title="U.S. Route 30">U.S. Route 30</a> with the new wider highway.</p>
<p>As the first Trans-National Highway, with congressional funding for a U.S. road network that was already defined by auto-clubs, the highway was almost always locally relevant, and thereafter grew in importance with the growth of the nation. When the Interstate Highway system was funded, and sometimes locally as some cities, counties or states improved their own local highway networks, stretches of road containing a lot of turns, frequent stops (traffic signals), and-or narrow hard to widen ways and roadbeds, stretches of local roads became bypassed and locally named Old Lincoln Highway.</p>

<p>In 1914, Effie Gladding wrote <i>Across the Continent by the Lincoln Highway</i> about her travel adventures on the road with her husband Thomas. Subsequently, Gladding wrote the foreword to the Lincoln Highway Association's first road guide, directing it to women motorists. Her 1914 book was the first full-size hardback book to discuss transcontinental travel, as well as the first to mention the Lincoln Highway:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">We were now to traverse the Lincoln Highway and were to be guided by the red, white, and blue marks: sometimes painted on telephone poles; sometimes put up by way of advertisement over garage doors or swinging on hotel signboards; sometimes painted on little stakes, like croquet goals, scattered along over the great spaces of the desert. We learned to love the red, white, and blue, and the familiar big L which told us that we were on the right road.</div>

<p>In 1916, "Mistress of Etiquette" <a href="Emily_Post" title="Emily Post">Emily Post</a> was commissioned by <a href="Collier's" title="Collier's">Collier's</a> magazine to cross the United States on the Lincoln Highway and write about it. Her son Edwin drove, and an unnamed family member joined them. Her story was published as a book, <i>By Motor to the Golden Gate</i>. Her fame came later in 1922, with the publication of her first etiquette book.</p>
<p>In 1919, author Beatrice Massey, who was a passenger as her husband drove, travelled across the country on the Lincoln Highway. When they reached Salt Lake City, Utah, instead of taking the rough and desolate Lincoln Highway around the south end of the Salt Lake Desert, they took the even more rough and more desolate "non-Lincoln" route around the north end of the Great Salt Lake. The arduousness of that section of the trip was instrumental in the Masseys deciding to ditch their road trip in Montello, Nevada (northeast of Wells, Nevada) where they paid $196.69 to board their automobile and themselves on a train to travel the rest of the way to California. Nevertheless, an enthusiastic Beatrice Massey wrote in her 1919 travelogue <i>It Might Have Been Worse</i>:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">

<p>In 1927, humorist Frederic Van de Water wrote <i>The Family Flivvers to Frisco</i>, an autobiographical account of him and his wife, a young couple from New York City, piling their belongings and their six-year-old son (dubbed the “<a href="Supercargo" title="Supercargo">Supercargo</a>”) into their Model T Ford and camping their way to San Francisco on the Lincoln Highway, traveling over 4,500 miles (7,200&#160;km) through twelve states in thirty-seven days. In his book, not much is made of the burden of traveling with a child who has a mind of his own. When they were forced by passing cars into a ditch near DeKalb, Illinois, Van de Water writes that his son, the Supercargo (a small irate figure in yellow oilskins), "scrambled over the door and started to walk in the general direction of New York." The Van de Waters' travel expenses for their entire trip amounted to 247 dollars and 83 cents.</p>
<p>In 1951, Clinton Twiss authored the famous and funny memoir <i><a href="The_Long,_Long_Trailer" title="The Long, Long Trailer">The Long, Long Trailer</a></i>, about his adventures living in a trailer and traveling across America with his wife Merle. Many of their episodes occurred on the Lincoln Highway, including almost losing their brakes coming down off <a href="Donner_Pass" title="Donner Pass">Donner Pass</a>, barely squeezing across the narrow <a href="Lyons-Fulton_Bridge" title="Lyons-Fulton Bridge" class="mw-redirect">Lyons-Fulton Bridge</a> over the <a href="Mississippi_River" title="Mississippi River">Mississippi River</a>, and getting stopped at the <a href="Holland_Tunnel" title="Holland Tunnel">Holland Tunnel</a> because trailers weren't allowed through.

<p>In April 1988, the <a href="University_of_Iowa" title="University of Iowa">University of Iowa</a> Press published <i>Lincoln Highway, the Main Street Across America</i>, a text-and-photo essay and history by <a href="../../w/index-title=Drake_Hokanson&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Drake Hokanson (page does not exist)">Drake Hokanson</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-19" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-19"><span>[</span>17<span>]</span></a></sup> Hokanson had been intrigued by the mystery of this once-famous highway, and tried to explain the fascination with the route in an August 1985 article in <i><a href="Smithsonian_(magazine)" title="Smithsonian (magazine)">Smithsonian</a></i> magazine:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">If it had been restlessness and desire for a better way across the continent that brought the Lincoln Highway into existence, it was curiosity that kept it alive—the notion that the point of traveling was not just to cover the distance but to savor the texture of life along the way.

<p>From 1995 through 2009, author and historian Gregory Franzwa (1926–2009) wrote a state-by-state series of books about the Lincoln Highway. Franzwa completed seven books: <i>The Lincoln Highway: Iowa</i> (1995), <i>The Lincoln Highway: Nebraska</i> (1996), <i>The Lincoln Highway: Wyoming</i> (1999), <i>The Lincoln Highway: Utah</i> (with Jesse G. Petersen, 2003), <i>The Lincoln Highway: Nevada</i> (with Jesse G. Petersen, 2004), <i>The Lincoln Highway: California</i> (2006), and <i>The Lincoln Highway: Illinois</i> (2009). The series is published by the <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.patricepress.com/">Patrice Press</a>. Each state book contains both detailed history and USGS level maps showing the various Lincoln Highway alignments. Franzwa served as the first president of the revitalized Lincoln Highway Association, in 1992.</p>
<p>In 2002, British author Pete Davies wrote <i>American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age</i>, about the <a href="Transcontinental_Motor_Convoy" title="Transcontinental Motor Convoy">1919 Army Convoy</a> on the Lincoln Highway. About the book, <i>Publishers Weekly</i> said:</p>
<blockquote class="templatequote">
<div class="Bug6200">In his newest book, Davies (Inside the Hurricane; The Devil's Flu) offers a play-by-play account of the 1919 cross-country military caravan that doubled as a campaign for the Lincoln Highway. The potential here is extraordinary. Using the progress of the caravan and the metaphor of paving toward the future versus stagnating in the mud, Davies touches on the industrial and social factors that developed the small and mid-sized towns that line the highways and byways of the nation.</div>

<p>In 2005, <i>Greetings from the Lincoln Highway: America’s First Coast-to-Coast Road</i>, a comprehensive <a href="Coffee_table_book" title="Coffee table book">coffee table book</a> by Brian Butko, became the first complete guide to the road, with maps, directions, photos, postcards, memorabilia, and histories of towns, people, and places. A mix of research and on-the-road fun, the book placed the LHA's early history in the context of roadbuilding, politics, and geography, explaining why the Lincoln followed the path it did across the US, including the oft-forgotten Colorado Loop through Denver. Butko's book also incorporated quotes from early motoring memoirs and postcard messages&#160;— sometimes funny, sometimes painfully descriptive of early motoring woes&#160;— hence the <i>Greetings</i> title. Butko had previously written an exhaustive guide to the Lincoln Highway in Pennsylvania in 1996, which was revised and republished in 2002 with different photos and postcard images.<sup id="cite_ref-20" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-20"><span>[</span>18<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
