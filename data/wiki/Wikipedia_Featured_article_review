<p>This page is for the review and improvement of <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_articles" title="Wikipedia:Featured articles">featured articles</a> that may no longer meet the <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_criteria" title="Wikipedia:Featured article criteria">featured article criteria</a>. FAs are held to the current standards regardless of when they were promoted.</p>
<p>There are three requisite stages in the process, to which all users are welcome to contribute.</p>
<p><b>Raise issues at article Talk:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>In this step, concerned editors attempt to directly resolve issues with the existing community of article editors, and to informally improve the article. Articles in this step are not listed on this page.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Featured article review</b> (FAR)</p>
<ul>
<li>In this step, possible improvements are discussed without declarations of "keep" or "delist". The aim is to improve articles rather than to demote them. Nominators must specify the featured article criteria that are at issue and should propose remedies. The ideal review would address the issues raised and close with no change in status.</li>
<li>Reviews can improve articles in various ways: articles may need updating, formatting, and general copyediting. More complex issues, such as a failure to meet current standards of prose, comprehensiveness, factual accuracy, and neutrality, may also be addressed.</li>
<li>The featured article director, <a href="User_Raul654" title="User:Raul654">Raul654</a>, or his delegates <a href="User_Dana_boomer" title="User:Dana boomer">Dana boomer</a> and <a href="User_Nikkimaria" title="User:Nikkimaria">Nikkimaria</a>, determine either that there is consensus to close during this second stage, or that there is insufficient consensus to do so and so therefore the nomination should be moved to the third stage.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Featured article removal candidate</b> (FARC)</p>
<ul>
<li>An article is never listed as a removal candidate without first undergoing a review. In this third stage, participants may declare "keep" or "delist", supported by substantive comments, and further time is provided to overcome deficiencies.</li>
<li>Reviewers who declare "delist" should be prepared to return towards the end of the process to strike out their objections if they have been addressed.</li>
<li>The featured article director or his delegates determine whether there is consensus for a change in the status of a nomination, and close the listing accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each stage typically lasts two to three weeks, or longer where changes are ongoing and it seems useful to continue the process. Nominations are moved from the review period to the removal list, unless it is very clear that editors feel the article is within criteria. Given that extensions are always granted on request, as long as the article is receiving attention, editors should not be alarmed by an article moving from review to the removal candidates' list.</p>
<p>Older reviews are stored in the <a href="archive/index.html" title="Wikipedia:Featured article review/archive">archive</a>. A <a href="Wikipedia_Featured_article_candidates/archiving" title="Wikipedia:Featured article candidates/archiving">bot will update the article talk page</a> after the review is closed and moved to archives; the delay in bot processing can range from minutes to several days, and the <tt>{{FAR}}</tt> template should remain on the talk page until the bot updates <tt>{{articlehistory}}</tt>.</p>

<p><span style="font-size: 15pt"><b>Nominating an article for FAR</b></span></p>
<p>Nominators are strongly encouraged to assist in the process of improvement; they may post only one nomination at a time, should not nominate articles that are <a href="Wikipedia_Today's_featured_article" title="Wikipedia:Today's featured article">featured on the main page</a> (or have been featured there in the previous three days), and should avoid segmenting review pages. Three to six months is regarded as the minimum time between promotion and nomination here, unless there are extenuating circumstances such as a radical change in article content.</p>
<ol>
<li>Before nomination, raise issues at talk page of the article. Attempt to directly resolve issues with the existing community of article editors, and to informally improve the article. Articles in this step are not listed on this page.</li>
<li>Place {{subst:FAR}} at the top of the talk page of the nominated article. Write "FAR listing" in the edit summary box. Click on "Save page".</li>
<li>From the FAR template, click on the red "initiate the review" link. You will see pre-loaded information; please leave that text.</li>
<li>Below the preloaded title, write which users and projects you'll notify (see step 6 below), and your reason(s) for nominating the article, specifying the <a href="Wikipedia_WIAFA" title="Wikipedia:WIAFA" class="mw-redirect">FA criterion/criteria</a> that are at issue, then click on "Save page".</li>
<li><a class="external text" href="../../w/index-title=Wikipedia_Featured_article_review&action=edit&section=1.php.html">Click here</a>, and place your nomination at the top of the list of nominated articles, {{Wikipedia:Featured article review/name of nominated article/archiveN}}, filling in the exact name of the nominated article and the archive number N. Click on "Save page".</li>
<li>Notify relevant parties by adding {{subst:FARMessage|ArticleName|alt=FAR subpage}} ~~~~ (for example, {{subst:FARMessage|Superman|alt=Superman/archive1}} ~~~~) to relevant talk pages (insert article name). Relevant parties include main contributors to the article (identifiable through <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://vs.aka-online.de/wppagehiststat/">article stats script</a>), the editor who originally nominated the article for Featured Article status (identifiable through the Featured Article Candidate link in the Article Milestones), and any relevant WikiProjects (identifiable through the talk page banners, but there may be other Projects that should be notified). The message at the top of the FAR should indicate who you have notified.</li>

<li>This article underwent the FAC process in May 2006, and I believe that the process has become more stringent since then. I searched for <i>Halloween II</i> in WorldCat.org, and it looks like <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/films-of-john-carpenter/oclc/43036881&referer=brief_results">this</a> covers the film and is not referenced here. There is also <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.worldcat.org/title/new-american-teenagers-the-lost-generation-of-youth-in-1970s-film/oclc/799849741&referer=brief_results">this</a> that covers the film in part, but it is newer and can be excused. From what I can tell, there are not any books about this film and not too many specific chapters about the film. Seems like content is piecemeal, and I think there are probably more print sources covering different parts of the film. One can tell that whoever worked on this article had to work with what was available online, either originally or re-printed from periodicals. <a href="User_Erik" title="User:Erik">Erik</a> (<a href="User_talk_Erik" title="User talk:Erik">talk</a> | <a href="Special_Contributions/Erik" title="Special:Contributions/Erik">contribs</a>) 20:52, 30 December 2012 (UTC)</li>

<li>Agreed, the sources let it down, and I doubt it would pass FA now. That said, I wouldn't support the removal of the halloweenmovies.com interviews from the article, though IMDB should certainly be replaced. --<span style="text-shadow:grey 0.15em 0.15em 0.1em"><a href="User_Xensyria" title="User:Xensyria">xensyria</a></span><span style="text-shadow:grey 0.25em 0.25em 0.12em"><sup><a href="User_talk_Xensyria" title="User talk:Xensyria">T</a></sup></span> 09:10, 31 December 2012 (UTC)</li>

<li><b>Out of process</b> – I understand why those here feel that the article has problems, but there has been no prior notification on <a href="Talk_Halloween_II" title="Talk:Halloween II">Talk:Halloween II</a> that an FAR was imminent without improvements. This step is required by FAR instructions, to provide an opportunity for issues to be fixed before a potential FAR. With that in mind, I think one of the delegates should remove the nomination for now. It can be brought back later, after the proper talk page notification has been made, if the issues remain. <a href="User_Giants2008" title="User:Giants2008"><font color="blue">Giants2008</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Giants2008" title="User talk:Giants2008"><font color="darkblue">Talk</font></a>) 01:05, 1 January 2013 (UTC)

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because it seems very far from meeting current FA criteria, and the issues raised haven't been addressed. The (unprotected) article has been subject to many non-constructive edits since its last review in 2007. --<small><a href="User_Elekhh" title="User:Elekhh">ELEKHH</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Elekhh" title="User talk:Elekhh">T</a></sup></small> 13:46, 30 January 2013 (UTC)</p>
<p>Some of the most obvious problems are:</p>
<ul>
<li>1a.) Prose issues: <a href="Wikipedia_LEAD" title="Wikipedia:LEAD" class="mw-redirect">Lead</a> clumsy repeating "Boston" 16 times, and flood of statistics not mentioned in the article: "unofficial Capital, "21st largest", "tenth-largest metropolitan area", "fifth-largest Combined Statistical Area", "largest in British America", "third largest city in the British Empire", "international center", "leading finance center", "11th in the Z/Yen top", "number one for innovation", "world livability [...] 36th globally". Likely many more issues as reader feedback is 2.5 of 5 for "well written" (sample N=159)
<ul>
<li>I have gone through a quick copyedit of the intro. Can someone else be able to check if the corrections are sufficient? <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 05:40, 5 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>There have been some issues raised by EEng at <a href="Talk_Boston#Cut.2C_cut.2C_cut" title="Talk:Boston">Talk:Boston#Cut, cut, cut</a> which relate to the overall prose. --<small><a href="User_Elekhh" title="User:Elekhh">ELEKHH</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Elekhh" title="User talk:Elekhh">T</a></sup></small> 10:52, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Apparently EEng has already taken care of the listed prose issues. <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 05:08, 7 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>1b.) Comprehensive: The culture section doesn't provide a good summary of <a href="Culture_in_Boston" title="Culture in Boston">culture in Boston</a>
<ul>
<li><b>Done</b> - I think the improper use of headers gave the impression that the section does not provide a good summary, but if the section still does not properly summarize <a href="Culture_in_Boston" title="Culture in Boston">culture in Boston</a>, can you be more specific as to what is lacking? <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 05:40, 5 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>3.) Illustration issues:

<li>4.) Focus issues:
<ul>
<li>Navbarfarm&#160;: 12 navbars at the bottom.

<ul>
<li>I know this is marginal, but I still find the 10 navbars bewildering. And the "Mayors of cities with populations exceeding 100,000 in Massachusetts" sounds really trivial. --<small><a href="User_Elekhh" title="User:Elekhh">ELEKHH</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Elekhh" title="User talk:Elekhh">T</a></sup></small> 10:52, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>I have removed the navbars pertaining to the "Mayors of cities with populations exceeding 100,000 in Massachusetts" and "All-American City Award." However, since I didn't create the navbars I have no idea what articles those navbars are actually intended for (and they seem relevant to this article). If you feel that 8 navbars is still too many, I will defer to your judgement as to which ones should be kept. Now that you brought it up, should there be a standard as to when a navbar is appropriate? <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 05:08, 7 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>Good question. I could only find two essays on the topic with some good general principles and advice: <a href="Wikipedia_Navigation_templates" title="Wikipedia:Navigation templates">WP:Navigation templates</a> and <a href="Wikipedia_Avoid_template_creep" title="Wikipedia:Avoid template creep">WP:Avoid template creep</a>. Some could be nominated for deletion, but the question is really which ones are useful for this article? Is it likely that any reader would wish to navigate through all the localities of the Northeast megalopolis or Municipalities and communities of Suffolk County, Massachusetts, United States? Btw, at the 2007 FAR there were 4 navbars. In any case, I think with 8 is much better than with 12. Thanks also for all the other improvements. --<small><a href="User_Elekhh" title="User:Elekhh">ELEKHH</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Elekhh" title="User talk:Elekhh">T</a></sup></small> 03:23, 10 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>Fixed both remaining DABs. Remaining entries are redirects, most likely caused by some templates or navbars outside the article itself. Bare URL also fixed. The other URL points to a questionable source anyway, so needs further checking or a complete replacement. Just some minor tweaks, i'll leave the deeper content questions to the article's regular editors. <a href="User_GermanJoe" title="User:GermanJoe">GermanJoe</a> (<a href="User_talk_GermanJoe" title="User talk:GermanJoe">talk</a>) 14:44, 31 January 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<ul>
<li><b>Comment</b> – I still see several dead link tags (93, 94, 100, 101, 206) in the article. These should be taken care of while this is at FAR. The Internet Archive may have copies of the dead-linked pages; if the Boston Globe page isn't available, I could probably find it with the library access I have. <a href="User_Giants2008" title="User:Giants2008"><font color="blue">Giants2008</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Giants2008" title="User talk:Giants2008"><font color="darkblue">Talk</font></a>) 00:08, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li>The current dead links refer to US Census data, particularly for 2000. At the moment, it is probably best to look at the 2010 dataset. But is there a bot somewhere that is doing this (the original 2000 census passages, if I recall correctly, were done by a bot)? <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 05:45, 6 February 2013 (UTC)
<ul>
<li><b>Done</b> - The dead links have been repaired, with most of the data updated using the 2010 Census data (where available). <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 06:26, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Comment</b> - some paragraphs still lack a final citation (first history, and a few more down the article). I wouldn't expect every tiny trivial detail to be sourced, but those broad aspects should have atleast a general source, where the info was taken from. Some narrative may be obvious for a Boston citizen, but still needs citation for the general readership. I'll try to help with another readthrough later. <a href="User_GermanJoe" title="User:GermanJoe">GermanJoe</a> (<a href="User_talk_GermanJoe" title="User talk:GermanJoe">talk</a>) 08:18, 6 February 2013 (UTC)

I am still looking to see if other areas need citations. <a href="User_Pentawing" title="User:Pentawing">Pentawing</a><sup><a href="User_talk_Pentawing" title="User talk:Pentawing">Talk</a></sup> 06:28, 13 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I'm sorry I hadn't noticed the photo issue had been resolved, Good work.
<p>However, there is now so much uncited in the article (particularly the later sections) that I have given up adding {{<a href="Template_Fact" title="Template:Fact" class="mw-redirect">fact</a>}} tags to it, and I think it needs a {{<a href="Template_Refimprove" title="Template:Refimprove">refimprove</a>}} banner.

<dd>I think the poetry sample is good and important.

<dd>I put a batch of tags in the article last night; perhaps I should put a section banner in.
<p>My point was that it seems that there seems to me to be even more unreferenced material now than when I first brought this article here.</p>
<p>As for the poetry sample, it would certainly be relevant to an article about Turkish poerry; I fail to see what point it makes about the language as a whole that it requires including the entire poem. <a href="User_Daniel_Case" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> (<a href="User_talk_Daniel_Case" title="User talk:Daniel Case">talk</a>) 15:24, 4 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd><b>Addendum</b>: OK, I see that the article on Swedish has a sample too. However, I a) note that it's much shorter, and doesn't include IPA and b) I question the need for a sample <i>at all</i> given that any decent article on a language would have more than enough samples included in its examples demonstrating grammar, syntax etc. that have the additional benefit of directly demonstrating what is described in the text.
<p>Just because our only two FAs on languages have sample sections does not mean that <i>all</i> our articles on languages should have one. <a href="User_Daniel_Case" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> (<a href="User_talk_Daniel_Case" title="User talk:Daniel Case">talk</a>) 15:34, 4 February 2013 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The addition of IPA in this article is an improvement relative to the Swedish article because it includes pronunciation help. Swedish and Turkish are not the only two featured articles on languages - <a href="Nahuatl" title="Nahuatl">Nahuatl</a> also includes a text sample. <a href="Mayan_languages" title="Mayan languages">Mayan languages</a> doesn't because it is abotu an entire language family. And no that doesn't mean that all article on languages have to - but it means that your point that is it superfluous is unjustified. It is just an "I dont like it" argument. <a href="User_Maunus" title="User:Maunus">·ʍaunus</a>·<a href="User_talk_Maunus" title="User talk:Maunus">snunɐw·</a> 15:38, 4 February 2013 (UTC)</dd>

<dd>Actually, it's <i>quite</i> feasible to record something, convert to .ogg, upload to Commons, and put it in the article. I've done this with videos ... audio shouldn't be a problem.

<p>I agree that the underreferencing (even if present when the article was promoted) is a serious threat to retaining this article as FA. I have asked two people from my university that work with Turkish, and while one refused, the other agreed to provide references at least for the stress part. Maybe even more, we shall see. I just want to suggest not to close FARC to quickly.

<p>Comparing the versions of 2007 and today:</p>
<dl>
<dd><b>(improvement)</b> Speaker number is addressed much more carefully in the disinformation box.</dd>
<dd><b>(detoriation)</b> Use of honorifics plays a too prominent role in the lead.</dd>
<dd><b>(detoriation)</b> Sentence about Tonyukuk is clumsily worded.</dd>
<dd><b>(equal)</b> The paragraph starting with “The past few decades ...” is unsourced. This was already the case when the article was promoted. The same holds for the next paragraph.</dd>
<dd><b>(equal)</b> Content and quality of the article up to but not including “Dialects” are roughly equivalent.</dd>
<dd><b>(arguably improved)</b> The dialect part was somewhat improved, even if the list style information in the latter part of the chapter is a bit overburdening. (One might consider getting it into another article and summarizing it on the basic of linguistic features. But in any case, even the preceding text has been slightly improved, so there is no decrease in quality.)</dd>
<dd><b>(arguably equal)</b> The phoneme status of soft g was discussed in a problematic manner in the first article, but the revision has yielded in inconsistent wording. The source is accessible, though, so this can probably be amended.</dd>
<dd><b>(deotiation)</b> The wording in the last paragraph of the consonant section (“When a vowel ...”) is a bit redundant; it could be shortened to two sentences.</dd>
<dd><b>(arguably detoriated)</b> “Consonant voicing and devoicing” is a useful short new section, but it fails to be integrated with what is mentioned in the preceding paragraph. It also confusingly talks about “letters” where one might expect a discussion of phonemes/allophones.</dd>
<dd><b>(detoriated in one respect, improved in one respect)</b> The unsourced addition (“However, ...”) in the “Vowels” section should be sourced or deleted. (The same section has gained a source, though, rendering it approximately equivalent with the previous version.)</dd>
<dd><b>(improved)</b> A useful comment on the accusative has been added to the nouns section, and new examples have been added to the ev table (still unsourced and as a paradigm of a major language probably even not requiring a source)</dd>
<dd><b>(improved notably)</b> The grammar section has overall been expanded, and the expansions are sourced and concern issues that merit to be mentioned.</dd>
<dd><b>(equal)</b> Vocabulary section basically unchanged.</dd>
<dd><b>(improved)</b> The writing system section has been somewhat expanded. One may argue that this can be put shorter or that the new length is better. In any case, adding a picture here (as language articles tend to have comparatively little of such supporting materials) seems a very good idea. The new examples are also helpful.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Summarizing, while a few minor edits are in place, the article has slightly improved compared to May 2007. The article should clearly be kept. I also want to express my concern here that a FARC such as by Daniel Case who relegates the actual reviewing work to others or (even worse) delists an article without recourse to article-internal facts unfairly shifts the burden of proof against good articles. The burden should be with the reviewer. And unless he can provide any real evidence (that would have to argue that even the 2007 article did not meet current Wikipedia standards for FAs), he has both failed to demonstrate that the article detoriated or that it didn't meet FA criteria in the first place.</p>

<ul>
<li>My decision to vote delist does not by any means mean that the article will be delisted. Please try harder to understand this process before you comment. Other editors would have to agree with me that it had declined sufficiently for that to happen. We do have to have <a href="Wikipedia_CON" title="Wikipedia:CON" class="mw-redirect">consensus</a>.</li>
<li>I assume you meant that I was relegating the actual work of <i>restoring</i> the article to others. As I freely admitted, I don't have the expertise. But I did have some concerns that this had to be at least reviewed because it seemed to have declined, not least because the three editors who developed it to FA and looked after it have all left Wikipedia. I provided some evidence that it might have indeed suffered, especially compared to <a href="Swedish_language" title="Swedish language">Swedish language</a>, currently our only other language FA. The burden of proof <i>always</i> rests with those who would have an article kept.</li>
<li>The article could indeed be found to up to 2007 standards but not today's, and thus delisted. <a href="Wikipedia_CCC" title="Wikipedia:CCC" class="mw-redirect">Consensus can change</a>. <a href="User_Daniel_Case" title="User:Daniel Case">Daniel Case</a> (<a href="User_talk_Daniel_Case" title="User talk:Daniel Case">talk</a>) 05:14, 4 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<dd>I think that Purevdorj makes good points.

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because... It's completely one-sided. It was promoted to FA in 2006, and offered then quite a neutral view of the place. Since then, several less-than-perfect aspects have been made to disappear, and criticisms have been archived with the issues raised left unresolved.</p>
<p>Examples from the first quarter of the 2006 article&#160;:</p>
<dl>
<dd>"Detroit's <a href="Crime_index" title="Crime index" class="mw-redirect">crime rate</a> has created international notoriety and a tarnished reputation. The city continues to struggle with the burdens of racial disharmony between itself and its <a href="Suburb" title="Suburb">suburban</a> neighbors, and an antiquated <a href="Industrial_Revolution" title="Industrial Revolution">economy</a>."</dd>
<dd>"The 1960s and 1970s saw the rise of <a href="Heroin" title="Heroin">heroin</a>, and a <a href="Crack_cocaine" title="Crack cocaine">crack cocaine</a> epidemic. Drug-related property crimes and violence among competing drug dealers rose, and urban renewal efforts led to the razing of abandoned homes."</dd>
<dd>"The National Institute for Literacy declared in 1998 that 47% of Detroiters were "<a href="Functional_illiteracy" title="Functional illiteracy">functionally illiterate</a>.""</dd>
</dl>
<p>All of these statements were, as of 2006, properly sourced, as befit a FA. You'll find none of these in the current page, obviously biased, strongly in favor of an idyllic view of Detroit.</p>
<p>Such criticism has been made on the talk page, in August, then again in November&#160;: these comments disappeared from the talk page (left in a pristine condition...), archived without being answered.</p>
<p>As of today, I don't think the article is worth its FA-status anymore. <a href="User_Esprit_Fugace" title="User:Esprit Fugace">Esprit Fugace</a> (<a href="User_talk_Esprit_Fugace" title="User talk:Esprit Fugace">talk</a>) 10:41, 28 December 2012 (UTC)</p>

<li><b>Comment</b> – I briefly scanned through the article and saw that some unreferenced content has snuck into the article, which should be cleaned up one way or another (by adding citations or removing the content). The article isn't unsaveable by any means, so if an interested editor has the time and inclination to add sources, I think this could be salvaged. As for the nominator's comments, the literacy rate is over a decade out-of-date and new figures should be found if a figure is to be added for the purpose of commenting on Detroit in 2013. I haven't read the article thoroughly, and consequently can't give a solid opinion on whether POV issues exist. <a href="User_Giants2008" title="User:Giants2008"><font color="blue">Giants2008</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Giants2008" title="User talk:Giants2008"><font color="darkblue">Talk</font></a>) 01:09, 11 January 2013 (UTC)</li>

<li>Keep. No warrant for nomination. The article is one of the best and most referenced city articles. Show us a city article that is better in order to discuss it. Of the items mentioned, the only cited one, Forbes discredited the source of the original literacy report.<a href="User_Thomas_Paine1776" title="User:Thomas Paine1776">Thomas Paine1776</a> (<a href="User_talk_Thomas_Paine1776" title="User talk:Thomas Paine1776">talk</a>) 19:16, 13 January 2013 (UTC)</li>
<li>I'm of two minds here. The statement by the nominator is akin to a withdrawal, and I'm not happy with how the whole nomination went down, from not notifying the primary contributors immediately to never posting on article talk as the instructions call for. On those grounds, I think a delegate could justify declaring the whole FAR out of process. On the other hand, I still think the level of citation could use some work; in particular, I see a lot of uncited items in the topography and college sections. If comparisons are sought, <a href="Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a> and <a href="Dorset" title="Dorset">Dorset</a> are two FAs passed recently that seem to have more thorough referencing. <a href="User_Giants2008" title="User:Giants2008"><font color="blue">Giants2008</font></a> (<a href="User_talk_Giants2008" title="User talk:Giants2008"><font color="darkblue">Talk</font></a>) 03:14, 3 February 2013 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Remove FA Status</b>. I will say what I already said on the article's talk page: "This article manages to take the small and scattered bits of semi-good news about Detroit and combine them to make it sound like Detroit is doing better than ever. The decline of Detroit's economy, population, and overall well-being has been by far the most important theme of Detroit's history in the past several decades, and this article needs to speak of it. Until that happens, this article's FA status needs to be removed." I will throw <a href="Wikipedia_Neutral_point_of_view" title="Wikipedia:Neutral point of view">NPOV</a> out there as reason for removal of FA status, as this article gives extremely disproportional weight to the idea that Detroit is doing well. Other than that, I also see a lot of uncited material. --<a href="User_Philpill691" title="User:Philpill691">Philpill691</a> (<a href="User_talk_Philpill691" title="User talk:Philpill691">talk</a>) 22:57, 6 February 2013 (UTC)</li>
<li><b>Demote</b>. The article fails to adequately cover essential themes of the topic, specifically the decline of a once-great city. I see boosterism from Thomas Paine1776 as the stumbling block to improvement. I see nobody stepping forward to make the required changes.<br />
Note that <a class="external text" href="../../w/index-title=Detroit&oldid=55703397.php.html">the 2006 FA version</a> was decidedly more truthful than what we see here now. It discussed how "Detroit leads the nation in terms of declining urban population" and how "Detroit's crime rate has created international notoriety and a tarnished reputation". It discussed "racial disharmony", "an antiquated economy" and "budget shortfalls". <a href="User_Binksternet" title="User:Binksternet">Binksternet</a> (<a href="User_talk_Binksternet" title="User talk:Binksternet">talk</a>) 23:42, 6 February 2013 (UTC)</li>

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because this article was promoted in 2005 and has never been re-reviewed. In the past seven years, the featured article criteria have become more strict, and unfortunately this article has not kept pace. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is significantly under-referenced, with many sections and paragraphs being partially or completely unreferenced. There is one cleanup banner and several in-line tags related to this issue.</li>
<li>There is a relatively large proportion of references to works written by the article's subject, in spots where third-party referencing is needed.</li>
<li>The size of the further reading section makes me wonder if the article is comprehensive, or if it is just that these articles need to be worked in to the in-line citations to rectify the referencing issues.</li>
<li>More minor issues, such as page numbers needed for books, date standardization and a clarification needed tag, also exist.</li>
</ul>
<p>Overall, this article doesn't meet the featured article criteria as they stand today. <a href="User_Dana_boomer" title="User:Dana boomer">Dana boomer</a> (<a href="User_talk_Dana_boomer" title="User talk:Dana boomer">talk</a>) 16:32, 16 October 2012 (UTC)</p>

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because this article had been rated FA in September 2006. Since then, the article has undergone lots of edits. The article underwent an FA-review in late 2008 and was "Kept". However, since then, I observe that plenty of additions and removals have been made. Too much unsourced and POV stuff has been added that this time around, I don't think that the article satisfies the minimum sourcing criteria. Concerns have also been frequenty raised.-<a href="User_Ravichandar84" title="User:Ravichandar84"><font style="color:white;background:aqua;" size="font-weight:normal" face="Monotype Corsiva">Ravi</font></a><sub><a href="User_talk_Ravichandar84" title="User talk:Ravichandar84"><font color="red" face="Monotype Corsiva">My Tea Kadai</font></a></sub> 03:42, 13 November 2012 (UTC)</p>

Many of the Sastri refs are doubled with more recent ones, &amp; a long term diff over 3 years doesn't actually show much problemmatic addition to my inexpert eye.

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because it is significantly under-referenced, with many sections and paragraphs being partially or completely unreferenced. This is the most major issue, with one section having a references-needed banner that has been present for almost two years. Other issues include:</p>
<ul>
<li>The external links section needs a trim, and possible merging with the "learning resources" section.</li>
<li>The very short "Miscellaneous section" should be integrated with one of the other sections.

<li>21st century section is basically a non-bullet point pop culture section, and completely unferenced.</li>

<li>Ref #53 (Dirk van Kampen) and #56 (Chris Hakkennes) need page numbers</li>
<li>Book ref formatting is all over the place - different page number formats, with/without book title, full info in notes for some and references for others, etc.</li>

<p>Very nicely written article, but does need additional referencing. This subject isn't my forte and the primary editors that brought this article to FA have apparently been inactive for some time. The issues covered in this article aren't of a controversial nature so delisting due to the issues listed above seems a shame. I can't see the urgency for this FAR though I concur that additional referencing should be added. Has anyone tried to reach out to the primary authors via email to inform them of this FAR?--<a href="User_MONGO" title="User:MONGO">MONGO</a> 01:26, 26 September 2012 (UTC)</p>
<dl>
<dd>Not sure why we would use e-mail? Three of the four most frequent contributors are still active, and have been notified on their talk pages, per the guidelines. Also, there is no "urgency" to the FAR - it's just a FA from 2006 that has yet to be re-reviewed, has had a major cleanup banner for <i>two years</i>, and had a talk page notification made over a week ago with absolutely no response; that's not exactly a quick-moving process. <a href="User_Dana_boomer" title="User:Dana boomer">Dana boomer</a> (<a href="User_talk_Dana_boomer" title="User talk:Dana boomer">talk</a>) 11:54, 26 September 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Agreed, the lack of sourcing is a <i>major</i> issue here.

<p>I am nominating this featured article for review because the issues I raised in February about the article still exist:</p>
<ul>
<li>Missing page numbers in references eg. Børtnes (2006).</li>
<li>Ref 25 is <a href="General_Roman_Calendar_of_1962" title="General Roman Calendar of 1962">General Roman Calendar of 1962</a>. An article is considered unreliable, by default</li>
<li>Use of <a href="Wikipedia_PRIMARY" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect">WP:PRIMARY</a> references: PG, 37.1157–9, Carm. de vita sua, ll 1828–55.</li>
<li>Inconsistency in references</li>
<li>Comprehensiveness:
<ul>
<li>Primary sources of his biography?</li>
<li>Primary sources of his theology</li>
<li>What are his relics?</li>
<li>A Doctor of the Church should definitely have a more comprehensive section on theology and views.</li>
</ul>

<li>Many of the the page references are in the article but supressed. Go into edit mode and you'll find the page refs for Børtnes, etc.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Ref 25 and associated material have been removed. Nonetheless, I'd appreciate it if you can describe why the General Roman Calendar of 1962 isn't a reliable source for describing how his feast day was historically observed.</li>
<li>I have changed a PG citation to cite a secondary source. There are still some PG citations in the article, but they are, I believe, used exclusively for direct quotations - a practice which allowed under <a href="Wikipedia_PRIMARY" title="Wikipedia:PRIMARY" class="mw-redirect">WP:PRIMARY</a>.</li>
</ul>

<dd><a href="Patrologia_Graeca" title="Patrologia Graeca">Patrologia Graeca</a> (PG) is in Greek. The English translation of the quote may be flawed.

<ul>
<li>Inconsistency in references: please provide examples of what you'd like changed. There may be an issue which arose from one of the damnable bots which periodically changes reference format. Guys, if you want to de-list the article because citations have been wrecked by bots, please do so. I'm tired of cleaning up after them.</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>Besides inconsistency in point 1, look at formatting of ref 17 and 21; then where pages are in text compare ref 2 and 15. Citation formatting is not a huge issue, comprehensiveness is. --<a href="User_Redtigerxyz" title="User:Redtigerxyz"><font color="red">Redtigerxyz</font></a> <sup><a href="User_talk_Redtigerxyz" title="User talk:Redtigerxyz">Talk</a></sup> 06:12, 26 October 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<li>His relics are primarily his bodily remains, including a creepy-looking skull. I haven't found a reliable source which goes into details about which specific bones and tissues are contained in his reliquery. (Is that level of macabre detail really necessary for the article to be considered complete?). I'll keep looking for reliable sources detailing his relics, but I have my doubts that it's anything other than <i>de minimus</i> material.</li>
<li>The primary source of his biography is his own writings. Thanks for the suggestion; it would be helpful to include a sentence to that efffect (probably sourced from McG).</li>
</ul>
<dl>
<dd>"Theological and other works" does not detail the names of his books/writings and the core subjects and views in each. A generic "theological writings" is used. Which writings? "Gregory's most significant theological contributions arose from his defense of the doctrine of the Trinity." what is the source of this? His own writings/his hagiographies/his discourses recorded by others???? I googled and found that the primary ref "Carm. de vita sua" is actually his book <i>Carmen de vita sua</i>, which is unnamed in the article. Also add the language in which the books are written. --<a href="User_Redtigerxyz" title="User:Redtigerxyz"><font color="red">Redtigerxyz</font></a> <sup><a href="User_talk_Redtigerxyz" title="User talk:Redtigerxyz">Talk</a></sup> 06:21, 26 October 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<li>Probably doesn't need much work. References may need tidying, but I'm not too sure about the other points. The article mentions his works began to be translated into Latin, from of course Greek. There's no reference to him ever even visiting a Latin-speaking region, so it hardly needs mentioning, though if people are raising the question perhaps it should be. The article did already mention "He also began composing De Vita Sua, his autobiographical poem...." - using the more usual Latin title. A little should be added on what sources about, &amp; writings by him we have - evidently a small minority of the original output, as usual at this date, and a mixture of letters and sermons. I don't really think the questions about relics or influences actually need resolving, though his actual theological views could be expanded on a bit. <a href="User_Johnbod" title="User:Johnbod">Johnbod</a> (<a href="User_talk_Johnbod" title="User talk:Johnbod">talk</a>) 04:00, 27 December 2012 (UTC)</li>
