<p><b><a href="Science" title="Science">Science</a></b> – systematic effort of acquiring knowledge—through observation and experimentation coupled with logic and reasoning to find out what can be proved or not proved—and the knowledge thus acquired.

Modern science respects <a href="Objective" title="Objective">objective</a> <a href="Logical_reasoning" title="Logical reasoning">logical reasoning</a>, and follows a set of core procedures or rules in order to determine the nature and underlying natural laws of the universe and everything in it.

<p><a href="Outline_of_scientific_method" title="Outline of scientific method">Scientific method</a> – body of techniques for investigating phenomena and acquiring new knowledge, as well as for correcting and integrating previous knowledge. It is based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence, and subject to laws of reasoning, both deductive and inductive.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Empirical_method" title="Empirical method">Empirical method</a> –</li>
<li>Experimental method – The steps involved in order to produce a reliable and logical conclusion include:
<ol>
<li>Asking a question about a natural <a href="Phenomenon" title="Phenomenon">phenomenon</a></li>
<li>Making observations of the phenomenon</li>
<li>Forming a <a href="Hypothesis" title="Hypothesis">hypothesis</a> – proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. Scientists generally base scientific hypotheses on previous observations that cannot satisfactorily be explained with the available scientific theories.</li>
<li><a href="Predicting" title="Predicting" class="mw-redirect">Predicting</a> a logical consequence of the hypothesis</li>
<li>Testing the hypothesis through an <a href="Experiment" title="Experiment">experiment</a> – methodical procedure carried out with the goal of verifying, falsifying, or establishing the validity of a hypothesis. The 3 types of scientific experiments are:
<ul>
<li><a href="Controlled_experiment" title="Controlled experiment" class="mw-redirect">Controlled experiment</a> – experiment that compares the results obtained from an experimental sample against a control sample, which is practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect the effect of which is being tested (the independent variable).</li>
<li><a href="Natural_experiment" title="Natural experiment">Natural experiment</a> – empirical study in which the experimental conditions (i.e., which units receive which treatment) are determined by nature or by other factors out of the control of the experimenters and yet the treatment assignment process is arguably exogenous. Thus, natural experiments are observational studies and are not controlled in the traditional sense of a randomized experiment.
<ul>
<li><a href="Observational_study" title="Observational study">Observational study</a> – draws inferences about the possible effect of a treatment on subjects, where the assignment of subjects into a treated group versus a control group is outside the control of the investigator.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="Field_experiment" title="Field experiment">Field experiment</a> – applies the scientific method to experimentally examine an intervention in the real world (or as many experimentalists like to say, naturally occurring environments) rather than in the laboratory. See also <a href="Field_research" title="Field research">field research</a>.</li>
