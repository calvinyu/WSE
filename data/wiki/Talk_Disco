<p>I just watched the "Rock with You" video for the first time in a long time. I think it qualifies as disco. It has violins, it's funky, and it has a "4 to the floor" beat. What do you think? Does the song deserve specific mention in the article, or is the article long enough and replete with enough mentions to the Jacksons already? <a href="../../w/index-title=User_Ikan_Kekek&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="User:Ikan Kekek (page does not exist)">Ikan Kekek</a> (<a href="User_talk_Ikan_Kekek" title="User talk:Ikan Kekek">talk</a>) 07:37, 26 June 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I think it's self-evident that most of the songs on <i>Off The Wall</i> were disco. They were <i>played</i> in discoteques, they were on the disco music charts, and the album even included a song called "Burn This Disco Out", in the same style as most of the other songs. What's blatantly obvious to most people shouldn't be considered OR -- although, yes, it's better off if they're sourced. (Anyway, I've never encountered anyone asserting that "Rock with You" is NOT disco.) <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 11:21, 9 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>PS. If "Philadelphia Freedom" -- which I personally don't think of as disco -- can be considered a nod to disco, then why not "Rock with You"? A song is or isn't disco based on its <i>musical style</i>, not whether someone <i>calls</i> it disco. <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 11:24, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

<dd>PPS. I removed "Philadelphia Freedom" from the list. If it's disco, then roosters lay eggs.

<p>I made two reverts in the original from LGBT back to Gay and I deleted hippie as an influence altogether</p>
<p>LBGT. First of all LBGT was a term that did not exist in the early 1970's. While there might have been lesbians and bisexuals involved in the formation of disco music the primary homosexual demographic involved in the formation of disco music and culture were gay men. The fact the lesbians are people also is completely irreverent.</p>
<p>Hippies - The Hippie encyclopedia used as their primary source the Wikipedia article on hippies. Using Wikipedia as a source is not allowed. On the merit the claim of hippie is very questionable. Sly and The Family Stone were a hippie band that was very important in the formation of disco music. Beyond that there is really no other hippie group that comes immediately to mind. Hippies are primarily associated with rock music not disco. Ex hippies were heavily involved in the backlash against disco music. Hippies were dress down disco was dress up. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 01:35, 8 August 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Are you joking, or what? ("<i>The fact the lesbians are people also is completely irreverent</i>") w-wait.. lesbians are people too, aren't they?&#160;:D or do you mean they're aliens? Seriously, I think you're so wrong. Hippies HAD great impact on emerging Disco music (at the time it was "proto disco" music) so do all of LGBT people - transgenders, lesbians, gay, bisexuals - all of these people had influence on proto disco, not only gay men, you're so selfish.. oh no no no.. don't think about it.. this isn't some kind of "personal attack" stuff, you know. What is Psychedelia at all? Culture of hippies. Yeah, I get it, so do you?! <b>Oh, by the way</b> term <i>Disco</i> did not exist, since the year 1973.. so do term "LGBT", as you said, but this is the year 2009 and we have write this article of 2009-point-of-view (or somewhat that), <a href="No" title="No">am I right?</a> ☆ <a href="User_RockandDiscoFanCZ" title="User:RockandDiscoFanCZ" class="mw-redirect">RockandDiscoFanCZ</a> (<a href="User_talk_RockandDiscoFanCZ" title="User talk:RockandDiscoFanCZ" class="mw-redirect">talk</a>) 12:45, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>In the big scheme of things of course it is important that lesbians are people to. But the fact that lesbians are people to is irrelevant to THIS ARTICLE. The only thing that matters for THIS ARTICLE is their role in the formation of disco music. So you have to prove with reliable sourcing that lesbians and hippies had an important role in the formation of disco music or culture. Otherwise it is just your opinion or original research and it can not go in the article. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 20:25, 8 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>OK. Hippie sources: [12], [13]. What I found: <a href="Electric_Circus_(nightclub)" title="Electric Circus (nightclub)">Electric Circus (nightclub)</a> - this influential discotheque had also great impact on rising disco music on late 1960s.. and the big thing.. it was a "<a href="Psychedelic_shack" title="Psychedelic shack" class="mw-redirect">hippie discotheque</a>", so 1:0 for <a href="Drugs" title="Drugs" class="mw-redirect">hippies</a>. Why you anyway want to delete that hippie origins? <a href="Wikipedia_No_personal_attack" title="Wikipedia:No personal attack" class="mw-redirect">You hate hippies, or what?</a> And why you defend "gay" origins, although proto-disco was only played on that gay discotheques (and I guess it wasn't only <a href="Rainbow" title="Rainbow">gay</a> males who had discotheques, also shemale discotheques, bisexual discotheques, lesbians discotheques.. and many others.. but I can't found any sources by now, *<a href="Sob" title="Sob" class="mw-redirect">sob</a>*.. <a href="Drama_queen" title="Drama queen" class="mw-redirect">ah life sucks</a>), I mean.. they're just putting that records on, that's all.

<dd>The statement in the Electric Circus article claiming influence on disco culture is not sourced. It is a poor article because the the material not sourced or uses poor sources. But lets assume that your claim is true. That is one club that catered to hippies that was influential. You can not make a claim that the hippie movement as a whole was influential. There were dozens then hundreds of black and gay proto disco clubs so making a general statement of black and gay influence is accurate, making it about hippies is not. You claim there were shemales etc in the audience but again have you no sources for that claim. What I do know is that the multiple sources we do have including ""Out in Culture: Gay, Lesbian and Queer Essays on Popular Culture" all use the word gay not LBGT and not hippie.</dd>
<dd>Your have a serious but understandable misunderstanding of how Wikipedia articles should be written. We do not print things because they are true, we do not print things because it seems to make sense (Its a gay club there must have been shemales, lesbians etc in them).and we do not assume other editors are doing things for negative reasons like prejudice. We print material only because they are verified by reliable sources.</dd>
<dd>You need to read and understand these basic Wikipedia policies <a href="Wikipedia_Verifiability" title="Wikipedia:Verifiability">Wikipedia:Verifiability</a>,<a href="Wikipedia_No_original_research" title="Wikipedia:No original research">Wikipedia:No original research</a>,<a href="Wikipedia_Reliable_sources" title="Wikipedia:Reliable sources" class="mw-redirect">Wikipedia:Reliable sources</a>,<a href="Wikipedia_Assume_good_faith" title="Wikipedia:Assume good faith">Wikipedia:Assume good faith</a>. After that find a good source for the Electric Circus claim add a line about the club and its influence. Same thing with the broad LGBT. But if you can not find these sources you can't change the article.</dd>
<dd>I know I have been a bit harsh or forceful here and I am sorry it had to be that way. When I started editing here I made many of the same mistakes and poor assumptions that you are making I had to be "corrected" more then a few times. Truth be told sometimes I still have to be corrected, so I get it. Wikipedia policies are onerous.

<dd>The Village Voice reference is not a small one man but an excellent one. <a href="Simon_Reynolds" title="Simon Reynolds">Simon Reynolds</a> is a major music journalist. I changed "hippie" to psychedelic because that is mostly what was being discussed. Psychedelic culture was a part or a sub genre of the hippie culture. It did not define the culture as a whole. There were hippies that were not into psychedelic music and clothing. Some were into folk music, others Indian music, and many dressed down and very un psychedelic (See photographs of the crowd at Woodstock). And there was a large "back to the earth" or rural element to it that was the opposite of disco's urban roots. I added a bit of detail from the article in the early history. I even used the word hippie there. Allmusic was also a good reference. Many Wikipedia articles and Billboard use them. I added another early history line based on that cite. Another "hippie" thing you should look at is the <a href="Free_love" title="Free love">free love</a> movement for its influence. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 15:22, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>I see. Compromise.. also you're right! However "hippie culture" is the same as "psychedelic culture" (or subgenre if we say it correctly), but that's just point-of-view conflict, you know&#160;;). P.S. but wasn't hippie "free love" a big contrast to disco subculture?.. you know.. hippie culture was full of drugs and love, but disco culture was full of drugs and sex. I mean.. it was not some kind of "save the world" campaign, many weird religious orthodox people call it "time of sodom", because of its wild parties on nightclubs and discothèques. | And thanks for hippies stuff adding to the disco article. <a href="User_RockandDiscoFanCZ" title="User:RockandDiscoFanCZ" class="mw-redirect">RockandDiscoFanCZ</a> (<a href="User_talk_RockandDiscoFanCZ" title="User talk:RockandDiscoFanCZ" class="mw-redirect">talk</a>) 22:05, 10 August 2009 (UTC)

<dd>Point of View I don't think the hippie idea of disco sex was a "big contrast" to hippie "free love" but an evolvement. It all was casual sex.

<dd>Considering I added "gay" to the first sentence, I'm ambivalent as to whether "gay" or "LGBT" is used. If disco was primarily just a gay male thing, then yeah, "LGBT" doesn't really apply because it overrepresents the demographic. But if it does, then I don't think it really matters whether "LGBT" is used or not, even if the term didn't exist in the early 1970s. Lexicon changes with time, and "LGBT" can be a translative term for what term was otherwise used (but possibly may or may not ever be used anymore) in the past. - <a href="User_Gilgamesh" title="User:Gilgamesh">Gilgamesh</a> (<a href="User_talk_Gilgamesh" title="User talk:Gilgamesh">talk</a>) 02:27, 8 August 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>In the article, the following is stated with a reference:</p>
<p>"The first article about disco was written in September 1973 by Vince Aletti for Rolling Stone Magazine."</p>
<p>However, in the archives of this Talk page, we find this:</p>
<p>"The 1973 RS article used the compound `disco sound,' but the Oxford English Dictionary has references to `disco beat' as early as 1965."</p>
<p>I do not own a copy of the OED. It would be great if someone who does could check the references to "disco beat" (which might not be articles and, therefore, might not disprove the claim about Aletti's article), if any. If the unsigned comment added by 166.84.1.2 in the archives is accurate, it would be very interesting to see what was meant by the term in 1965, and I would think that we would probably want to include such references (again, if any) in this article.</p>

<dd>I don't have the Oxford English Dictionary either. A few years ago when the rock and roll hall of fame had a traveling disco exhibit they made the claim for and had a copy of Aletti's article. Discotheque was in common use by 1965 so it is possible somebody used "disco beat" in 1965. But there was nothing resembling disco music in 1965 as there was in 1973. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 21:12, 29 September 2009 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I did a major rewrite with the idea of putting one topic per paragraph. During the rewrite I came across material that was making the same point twice. When that happened I just left the quote from an actual person in. I renamed the section to reflect what was in the section. While I took out the sentence saying that there was not a focused backlash in Europe it was not because I think of it as unimportant. It was just that it is not great style to write about what did not happen and this section is about a US phenomenon. As I noted in the comments the various incarnations of Eurodisco need there own section(s). As I understand it there was some anti disco feeling in the UK among skinheads and the like but it never got to the level it did in the US. If cited material about this and other anto disco feeling elsewhere comes up the section could be renamed back. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 15:34, 10 October 2009 (UTC)</p>

<dd>The criticism by British punks of Disco and their like of reggae is noted in the "Factors" subsection of the "Backlash and Decline" section.

<dl>
<dd>It's clear (especially to those of us who were there in that time period) that the backlash was a part of a much larger cultural backlash associated with the conservative revolution; and that the whole situation was just one of yet another of the theaters where the proxy fight between the conservatives and liberals were (and still are) being fought -- with the problems during the times of the Carter administration at the center of it all. This is especially apparent with the tie-in of the musical genre to the gay, urban and black scenes, and the exaggerated white, suburban, machismo aspect of the opposing genres (urban cowboy, punk, etc.). These are also the alignments that emerged from the 1980's onward between the partisan groups that, in the US, eventually aligned themselves with the Democratic (liberal) and Republican (conservative) parties.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>We need more references and discussion to link this to the broader context of the times; for example: the timing of the Death of Disco relative to Carter's Malaise Speech, the Iran crisis, etc. <span style="font-size: smaller;" class="autosigned">— Preceding <a href="Wikipedia_Signatures" title="Wikipedia:Signatures">unsigned</a> comment added by <a href="../Special_Contributions/64.136.26.17" title="Special:Contributions/64.136.26.17">64.136.26.17</a> (<a href="../User_talk_64.136.26.17" title="User talk:64.136.26.17">talk</a>) 13:28, 8 January 2012 (UTC)</span></dd>

<dd>I disagree with the attribution of politics to disco's decline. A lot of the disco music, particularly in the later period, wasn't very good artistically, conventional rockers and rock fans (many of them liberals and Democrats, mind you) felt threatened, and any time something experiences a "meteoric rise" (like disco did) it's almost certain to suffer a fall. It would have been better for disco (although I can't prove this) if it, like rap and hip-hop, had risen more gradually and not so much as to threaten rock 'n roll's dominance. As the end of the "Factors" sub-section explains, the DDN organizers weren't thinking politically or culturally when they staged the event, and many in the industry had <i>artistic</i> reaons for opposing disco. <i>As I indicate below on this page, more research needs to be done into the artistic factors.</i> While there are SOURCES suggesting political and social reasons, I don't see any hard evidence establishing a cause-and-effect link. The "decline and backlash" section needs more balance. In any case, disco was never going to "replace" rock in the long run, and I think it would have declined even if the political realities were different. (Eurodisco may have fared better, but it too is only a shadow of its former self. And I don't think that the evolving USA demographics which many political analysts see as an "Emerging Democratic Majority" will make disco-type music regain popularity in the USA either: A lot of today's "neo-progressives" aren't into disco.) <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 10:48, 9 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Personally, I find the weakest part of the sociopolitical theories to be the mention of a bad economy. Yes, we had stagflation in 1979, but then so did we in earlier years of the decade. Even if a source poses the economy as a theory, it doesn't make sense. If people are suddenly losing money and jobs, how does that cause someone to switch from disco music to standard rock? All the records cost the same. And if you're down on your luck, a little dancing would hardly make you feel "worse"--although with your limited finances you'd probably stay home instead of go out to a club. I think the critics--like humans in general--overanalyzed the musical phenomenon and its decline, and we shouldn't port <i>all</i> of that armchair analysis into the article. If nothing else, the primary focus should be on <i>musical</i> reasons for disco's falling out of favor, with passing mention of the sociopolitical stuff. <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 18:50, 9 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>
<dd>Also, if the decline in disco was primarily about homophobia and racism, why then--given that racism and homophobia are a lot less today--is disco still dead? Using Oscam's razor, I'd argue that disco was a passing fad, and it would have faded no matter what racial, sexual, or political attitudes were at the time.

<p>Wikipedia currently lacks article on discofunk. I even doubt this genre existed, but I use this term for tracks like NYC Peach Boys - Don't Make Me Wait, I mean four-to-the-floor disco-like music but without orchestras, without soulful disco vocals but with a typical funk pattern instead (many wah-wah guitars, funky horns, simple to monotonic to declamative funky vocals etc.) that was kinda popular around 1977-1982.

<dd>Thanks to your efforts, I have found some information on that mysterious type of music called "disco funk". It is in the article on Boogie you had provided as a source for Post disco article. The other explanation of what disco funk could be has been found in one serious book on R&amp;B music. So I am probably going to make an article about it in some time. To uncover its meaning, disco funk is described either as "acoustic" funk of the 1980s, or as "typical" 1980s funk music. So that song by Peech Boys qualifies as disco-funk, yes -- <a href="User_Appletangerine_un" title="User:Appletangerine un">Appletangerine un</a> (<a href="User_talk_Appletangerine_un" title="User talk:Appletangerine un">talk</a>) 11:56, 10 December 2009 (UTC)

<p>I agree with the sentiment at the top of this section. A lot of the sources are from people linked to disco's contemporary musical competitors, suggesting bias. More research needs to be done--including citing more sources from inside the movement--to properly characterize disco. In particular, the reasons given for its decline, and their sources, make that section look like a sociopolitical assessment rather than a <i>musical</i> assessment. <i>I urge editors (besides me) to come up with sources having alternate points of view on disco and its decline.</i> All in all, it makes you wonder who <i>created</i> this article in the first place; it's a good article, but it sounds like it was written by someone who didn't "get it".

<dd>I'm not entirely sure what you mean. But from my own understanding, disco music started as a sort of blend of musical genres that were fashionable to gay, black and Latino communities. Many of the earliest adopters were gay, but not all of them were. So yeah, it's gay music, partially.

<dd>***QUOTE*** Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included Pan's People and Hot Gossip. For many dancers, the primary influence of the 1970s disco age is still predominantly the film Saturday Night Fever (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as Fame (1980), Flashdance (1983),"The Last Days of Disco"(1998), and the musical A Chorus Line (1975). It also helped spawn dance competition tv shows such as Dance Fever (1979).***QUOTE***</dd>

<dd>There are decent sections here, Early History, Influence on other music (needs some more sources).

<dd>Regarding the "no reliable sources claiming they are disco": Must every single song have somebody designating its style as such? (What about, say, "Disco Inferno"?) I think what constitutes disco depends on the music style and not on personal authority. Most of the songs listed were played in disco clubs and were listed on the "disco music" charts, even if those charts aren't explicitly referenced. See the "Michael Jackson" talk-section for more on this. (I know that "common sense" is anything but; however, most Wikipedia articles--even the very good ones--don't source what is <i>obvious</i> to most readers. I tell you, if we insisted on rigid absolute compliance with Wikipedia's rules in every instance, hardly a single article therein would pass muster.) <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 18:27, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

<dd>Yes absolutely every song listed should be reliably sourced as disco. As I said earlier this blanket laundry list of songs instead of most significant groups/songs is the wrong way to go but while I can't speak for every article but most of the songs listed here here probably do have reliable sources listing them as disco and these sources can be found with minimal research because they are "obvious" (Hate to break it to you because I have to break to myself but since unlike us most editors readers were born after disco it is probably not obvious). <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 06:11, 11 March 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I've included more detail about "crossover appeal" with non-disco artists and music fans. Also, I've created more sectional sub-division--especially with the "Pop pre-eminence" and "Backlash and decline" sections--for additional clarity. Finally, I've made a section out of the dubious paragraph about the "gay commentary" of disco, ala Village People, and moved it into the "Disco clubs and culture" section. It really doesn't belong in the "Pop pre-eminence" part.<a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 11:36, 4 March 2012 (UTC)</p>

<p>I know that MTV--or one of its sister channels--did a documentary on the disco era, blaming the success of <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> for causing disco to be overexposed, thus causing people to tire of it. I can't recall the specific show; if someone can come up with it and add the reference (to the final paragraph of "Factors") that would be great. Personally, I find it much more credible to blame the music itself for its decline (styles fall in and out of favor) than politics and prejudice, and I don't think the non-musical factors should have such a disproportionate emphasis.</p>
<p>I also think that the case for disco's decline being traced to a specific July 1979 event is over-made. Disco was <i>already</i> falling out of favor in 1978--cf. The Who's "Sister Disco", which some see as a critique of disco,--and incorporating heavy disco elements into pop/rock songs continued to make hits even after "Disco Demolition Night"--cf. Pink Floyd's "Another Brick In The Wall, Part 2", a hit of late 1979 and early 1980, and J. Geils Band's "Come Back" in 1980 (although the latter is sorta more representative of the 1980s' post-disco dance music). If nothing else, the final paragraph of the "opening section" at the top of the article should be revised to put less emphasis on the DDN event and more on evolving musical tastes. (Indeed, the opening is kinda long and includes a lot of details better off saved for the body of the article.)</p>

<dd>Disco was massively successful in the charts in 1978 and the first part 1979 despite the backlash which was starting to grow but had not reached full fruition. The change in the charts after DDN is hard to ignore, there is no signs of lowering of popularity prior to DDN. If I was am fan of a genre and it has six of the top ten songs I would like that type of "decline". I also think you are confusing disco elements or disco influence with full out disco songs. The article does note strong post DDN influence (although it badly needs a synthpop subsection). I would argue that the post disco "dance music" like Laura Brannegan , and soundtrack to "Flashdance" had a lot of strings and the outward 4/4 "boom boom boom" taken out and it was speeded up as a nod to punk.</dd>
</dl>
<dl>
<dd>You are not off the mark that DDN was more of a <a href="Tipping_point" title="Tipping point">tipping point</a> that ended the disco era then the event itself. Another words if it was not DDN it would have been something else but it did happen that way it happened. But when pretty much every reliable history, people involved, Rock and Roll Hall of Fame "Decade of Saturday nights" etc thinks it's important we can't downgrade it's importance because it doesn't sound right. Besides the language in the lede does not directly say DDN "caused" the genres downfall.</dd>

<dd>As for over saturation of Saturday Night Fever that language was in this article for years, why it was taken out I do not know. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 03:08, 19 September 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>Using Reliable Sources, verifiable not necessarily truth and no original research are the cornerstones of Wikipedia editing and you have gone against this. There are no citations used for your additions they seem to be based on what you "know" to be the truth. I get you are probably just editing by the article based on how others have edited this article. The "cornerstones" have been continuously been ignored here. That of course is not your fault but at the end of the day two wrongs do not make a right. As an editor seeing this situation I have several options ignore it, give a warning which I did on top of the article which I did months ago or delete the originally researched material which I did here.</p>
<p>I do not disapprove of what you are trying to do and you write well and are knowledgeable on the topic. I like the revised subsection headings but these rules have been put in place for a reason. To see a genre article that follows the rules look at <a href="Synthpop" title="Synthpop">this article</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, whilethe backlash was growing after '77 disco's popularity was not declining but hitting its peak. As we noted in the article the week of the Disco Demolition night the top 6 songs were disco. During one week in February 78 9 of the top 10 songs were from Saturday Night Fever. Most a the Rock star "disco" songs were in 1978-79. Notice that even though I "know" this to be the truth I have not added it to the article and won't until a I find reliable sources claiming this.</p>

<p><a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a>: In doing your revert, you removed a lot of non-objectionable additions, including corrections on band and song names; sub-section divisions about crossover appeal, disco revisions, and parodies; and additional examples of crossover songs and anti-disco songs. I have restored everything EXCEPT for the alternate interpretation of disco's decline--which, yes, was unsourced and therefore questionable. Personally, I still stand by the fact that an MTV-family station documentary was made (if anyone can find it and reference it, great) attributing disco's decline to artistic rather than social factors. My personal memory of the disco's decline--which I lived through, although personal experience is inadmissable--is that it had more to do with evolving musical tastes than with politics and prejudice. Even though those latter explanations are sourced, they don't ring true.

<dd>I might add that the contributions of The Jackson 5/The Jacksons/Michael Jackson are highly pertinent -- particularly their unique ability to survive and adapt in the 1980's. So is the influence of disco on groups like Pink Floyd, The Eagles, and the J. Geils Band -- and the first 2 groups' nods to disco ARE sourced. "Sister Disco"'s interpretation is on the page for The Who's <i>Who Are You</i> album (and I linked to the specific section therein), and as for Bob Seger "Old Time Rock and Roll" -- must I include its lyric, "Don't try to take me to a disco"? Finally, my original addition about disco's "overexposure" from <i>Saturday Night Fever</i> -- although not restored (and I still hope to find the show so I can source it) -- follows from the current end of "Factors", in which documented sources refer to "artistic reasons" for opposition to disco. <i>I suggest that editors pick up on that thread and come up with specific examples (sourced, of course) of artistic reasons for musicans and fans to reject or tire of disco during the late '70's.</i> That would create better <i>balance</i> to the article's explanation for disco's decline -- which currently and misleadingly (albeit with sources) suggests that disco somehow got a bum rap for primarily non-musical reasons. I don't dispute, "Verifiability, not truth" -- that just because something is true doesn't warrant inclusion, but consider the converse: Just because something IS sourced <i>doesn't</i> make it "accurate" enough to warrant inclusion, let alone emphasis. <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 10:18, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

<dd>One more thing: The changes to the "Pop-preminence" section -- including the creation of subdivisions regarding crossover appeal, disco-ization of popular tunes, and paradies -- is simply, except for the addition of few additional examples of songs, a re-organization of pre-existing material. I intend to continue to make the case for the (otherwise very cursory) changes to this section and its "Rise to mainstream" predecessor. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a>, you were right about a few specific additions being questionable, but I prefer <i>editing</i> to reverting in order to remove questionable material, lest legitimate additions be thrown aside in the process. <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 10:37, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

<dd>Where, in the article lead-in, it says that the popularity of disco markedly declined "as a result of" the DDN event, I changed "as a result of" to "in the wake of". We can't clearly establish cause-and-effect between the two things. Corellation and causation are not the same thing. People don't stop <i>listening</i> to a certain kind of music simply because a disgruntled DJ stages a protest. The people staging the event were tapping into a pre-existing sentiment that had been building for some time. (Of course, I don't have sources to clearly establish that disco's decline was a gradual and ongoing thing that DDN merely straddled chronologically, but if and when I do, I will say so in the article. And, once again, I stress that more research has to be done into <i>musical</i> reasons for disco's fall.) <a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 11:11, 9 March 2012 (UTC)
<dl>
<dd>I've edited the lead-in further, so that it only corellates the decline in <i>radio airplay</i> of disco with DDN, as there is no evidence that DDN specifically "caused" people to stop listening to disco and buying disco records -- what most would view as "popularity". [Airplay and popularity are different: Let's not forget that The Beatles' popularity was high in 1966, even as many radio stations deliberately avoided <i>playing</i> Beatles records in the wake of Lennon's Jesus <i>faux paus</i> -- ironically, proving John's point.] The first two sentences of the lead-in's final paragraph now read as follows:</dd>

<p><a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a>, I was already familiar with Wikipedia's policies regarding OR and sources, and I know that it is not necessarily necessary that a source be specifically cited in order to include something, provided that a source <i>exists</i>. I referred to an MTV documentary on the disco movement, and while I fault myself for not specifically mentioning "according to an MTV-related documentary" IN THE ARTICLE when attempting to talk musical reasons for disco's decline, the documentary <i>was</i> made, and anyone can look for it. I will attempt to find it, as it backs up most of what I said in the final paragraph of "Factors" that you removed by reversion. <b>(I will not re-add its points, though, until I can find it.)</b> In any case, what I originally added to "Factors" was not personal opinion or synthesis, and certainly wasn't intended as such. Once again, I suggest that if you find something objectionable, <i>just remove or alter the objectionable text or section.</i> Reverting the whole page sweeps away the grain with the chaff.</p>
<p>Also, I would have some advice for <i>you</i>, <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a>. Since the "omniscient narrator" of a Wikipedia article is supposed to be objective, any editor should avoid asserting causality when there's merely a corellation--except when including a clear "according to this source" qualification. This is especially important when attributing "outside" causes to something--i.e., <i>non-musical</i> factors in a <i>musical genre's</i> decline. The original final paragraph of the lead-in asserts a specific cause-and-effect relationship between DDN and disco's overall decline in popularity as if it were an established, proven fact. While reliable sources are a necessary condition for asserting something, they are not a <i>sufficient</i> condition. (And while "truth" may not be sufficient, it is <i>necessary.</i>) And in Logic Class I learned never to accept anything on pure authority. I don't think enough research has been done to provide a balanced set of factors for the genre's fall from grace--especially when no <i>artistic</i> explanations are given. (What? A form of music becomes passe for almost entirely non-musical reasons?! See the talk section on "Decline" above for more.)</p>
<p>I personally may not be the right person to comment on the artistic and other non-social reasons behind it (in fact, disco is hardly my favorite subject, despite my attention to this article), but someone should delve into the artistic problems musicians and music fans had with disco. The article should not attribute, with an air of "objectivity", a <i>single event in July 1979</i> to disco's wholesale fall--let alone have such an emphasis on non-musical factors without hard evidence as opposed to simply testimony of critics: i.e., Did <i>requests</i> for disco airplay or <i>sales</i> of disco records suddenly drop after July 1979? Did public opinion <i>polls</i> show a marked decline in support for disco soon after July 1979? Is there polling--or at least significant anecdotal testimony--of music fans giving political or "sociological" reasons for their not listening to or buying disco songs? Or do polls, sales, and requests on music in the late '70's show a more nuanced picture? (Research worth doing.)</p>

<p>I have revised "Factors" so that economic and political factors (source is preserved) are mentioned more obliquely and the mention of AIDS is removed. The major tanking of the Carter-era economy, the rise of Ronald Regan, and the becoming-public of AIDS all happened in 1980, <i>after</i> disco had starting tanking in a big way. Also, both ideas in the sentence cite the same source, so only one citation is needed. The opening sentence now reads:</p>

<dl>

</dl>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>I have also added that sentence to the following paragraph, and moved the last sentence or two of that (originally 2nd) paragraph, regarding the rock industry--along with Gloria Gaynor's theory (originally in the 1st)--to a separate paragraph at the end. The first two original paragraphs each lists both sociopolitical reasons and music-industry reason in the <i>same paragraph</i>; the music-industry specific stuff doesn't belong with the sociopolitical stuff. <i>Note that I have merely rearranged (and slighly rephrased) things!</i><a href="User_RobertGustafson" title="User:RobertGustafson">RobertGustafson</a> (<a href="User_talk_RobertGustafson" title="User talk:RobertGustafson">talk</a>) 19:25, 9 March 2012 (UTC)</p>

<dd>I also think that the sentences, "Legs McNeil, founder of the fanzine Punk, was quoted in an interview as saying, "the hippies always wanted to be black.

<p>I don't have time to go point by point but my basic view remains he same I agree with a lot of your points and respect your knowledge of the subject but have a problem with your what I think are your (and a lot of other editors of this article) over relaxed view of the rules.</p>
<p>"I advise that if you find a questionable addition, don't do a blanket revert--throwing out good with bad--but instead remove or fix the SPECIFIC questionable additions." OK but on the other hand you found questionable parts of the the article and did not make surgical changes but massive unsourced additions/revisions covering several sections of the article. It is up to the editor who adds material to find sources for it. An editor who finds unsourced originally research material has several required options 1. Give a citation or other warnings. I have done that by putting the warning for the entire article for specific parts of the article. These warnings have been ignored. 2. Deleted the unsourced/original researched material. 3. Do the job the other editor was supposed to do and try and find sources. If sources are found add the sources, if they are not warn or delete. I have done that also. Usually I add a warning, and a lot of time I will do the job the other editor should have done because while most unsourced/original researched additions I deal with turn out not to have reliable sources for their claims, once in awhile the addition is sourced and is a valuable addition to the article. For a massive revision like yours it is impractical for me since I have a life and it is frankly unfair to expect me or any editor to spend hours it requires to use option 2 or 3. And the overall state of the article is poor. <a href="Wikipedia_CHALLENGE" title="Wikipedia:CHALLENGE" class="mw-redirect">WP:CHALLENGE</a> <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a>(<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 07:11, 11 March 2012 (UTC).</p>
<p>Causation in the lede. That was not my addition. While you are right in wanting that out but it was for the wrong reason. The correct reason is are there there are no sources for that claim.</p>
<p>MTV documentary. You can use the documentary itself as a source. While hyperlinks are preferable they are not required.</p>
<p>Punk: Cut down yes, delete no. Sources do consistently mention it but it is the not the dominant theme. (My Point of View Punk a lot of times is given undue weight when discussing that era because of importance since the late 70's. In the late 70's in the US it was a very minor phenomenon).</p>
<p>As for the reasons for the backlash a lot of them are in the section or in the sources used in that section. The music industry losing money, view that disco fans were vapid and elitist, that the sound was overproduced and synthetic, rock stars "selling" out. See cite numbers 35,38,44.And they do note that DDN was important to the temporary demise of disco so this has to be noted in the article. Not cited so not in the article are overkill which inevitably lowers the quality of the sound and makes people sick of it.</p>
<p>Personal Note: I wrote something about going to blogs which might at first glance seem insulting or flippant but was written seriously. While you can not follow every rule and you certainly don't have to like them, you should make a reasonable effort to follow and respect them. You did that much better this time around still see "I know" "I think" as reasoning for revisions. Is Wikipedia the place for you? With your knowledge and writing skills I hope so as you can turn this article around. If not maybe I will be citing your article someday.</p>
<p>I will leave your revisions alone for a few weeks and see what you come up with.

<dd>Continual revisions and refusal to explain is tendentious editing is a form of vandalism. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 22:31, 10 April 2012 (UTC)</dd>

<p>I agree; please leave it as "gay" unless sources can be cited to suggest otherwise. There's a cited source that specifically mentions gay males. Where is the source that refers to the wider LGBT population? LGBT is not a strict synonym for gay. More generally, this is underscoring the need for more rigorous sourcing and citations in this article. You all know the rules. Take the time to support your contentious edits with citations. —<a href="User_Mjb" title="User:Mjb">mjb</a> (<a href="User_talk_Mjb" title="User talk:Mjb">talk</a>) 03:29, 11 April 2012 (UTC)</p>

<dd>Just watch the BBC documentary "Joy of Disco" . Hetrosexual Black male origins discussed, and and Gay Males heavily discussed as reacting to the <a href="Stonewall_Riots" title="Stonewall Riots" class="mw-redirect">Stonewall Riots</a>, female desire in mainstream pop as a result of the sexual revolution discussed, nothing with lesbians or LBGT discussed. Does not mean it did not happen but without reliable sources can not add it.</dd>

<p>Did rassism play a role in the anti-disco movement? Because many disco artist were black. So they were excluded from white society and went back to the ghetto to create Hip-Hop. And nowadays R&amp;B is king of music. But, I am not an American historian to know all this for sure. Still the anti-disco movement looks very white and very strange, too! Like a KKK event. Anyway, the message of disco was love and tolerance, the message of punk is rage and hatred, for sure. --<a href="../Special_Contributions/178.197.234.47" title="Special:Contributions/178.197.234.47">178.197.234.47</a> (<a href="../../w/index-title=User_talk_178.197.234.47&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="User talk:178.197.234.47 (page does not exist)">talk</a>) 04:07, 17 September 2012 (UTC)</p>

<dd>As noted in the article it believed by many reliable sources that racism and homophobia played a large part in the late 1970s anti disco backlash. Punk as rage and hatred is an extreame oversimplification. There were and are <a href="Skinhead" title="Skinhead">nazi hate punk rock</a> but a lot of punk has been <a href="Rock_Against_Racism" title="Rock Against Racism">anti racist</a>. As noted in the article many punk acts and fans that disliked disco loved raggae music and culture. <a href="User_Edkollin" title="User:Edkollin">Edkollin</a> (<a href="User_talk_Edkollin" title="User talk:Edkollin">talk</a>) 03:04, 18 September 2012 (UTC)</dd>
