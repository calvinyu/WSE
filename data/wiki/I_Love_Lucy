<p>Originally set in an apartment building in New York City, <i>I Love Lucy</i> centers on <a href="Lucy_Ricardo" title="Lucy Ricardo" class="mw-redirect">Lucy Ricardo</a> (<a href="Lucille_Ball" title="Lucille Ball">Lucille Ball</a>) and her singer/bandleader husband <a href="Ricky_Ricardo" title="Ricky Ricardo" class="mw-redirect">Ricky Ricardo</a> (<a href="Desi_Arnaz" title="Desi Arnaz">Desi Arnaz</a>), along with their best friends and landlords <a href="Fred_Mertz" title="Fred Mertz">Fred Mertz</a> (<a href="William_Frawley" title="William Frawley">William Frawley</a>) and <a href="Ethel_Mertz" title="Ethel Mertz">Ethel Mertz</a> (<a href="Vivian_Vance" title="Vivian Vance">Vivian Vance</a>). During the second season, Lucy and Ricky have a son named Ricky Ricardo Jr. ("Little Ricky"), whose birth was timed to coincide with Ball's real-life delivery of her son Desi Arnaz Jr.<sup id="cite_ref-birthofamemo_4-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-birthofamemo-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<p>Lucy is naive and ambitious, with an undeserved zeal for stardom and a knack for getting herself and her husband into trouble whenever Lucy yearns to make it in show business. The Ricardos' best friends, Fred and Ethel, are former <a href="Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudevillians</a> and this only strengthens Lucy's resolve to prove herself as a performer. Unfortunately, she has few marketable performance skills. She does not seem to be able to carry a tune or play anything other than off-key renditions of songs such as "Glow Worm" or "Sweet Sue" on the <a href="Saxophone" title="Saxophone">saxophone</a>, and many of her performances devolve into disaster. However, to say she is completely without talent would be untrue, as on occasion, she is shown to be a good dancer and a competent singer. She is also at least twice offered contracts by television or film companies—first in "The Audition" when she replaces an injured clown in Ricky's act, and later in Hollywood when she dances for a studio benefit using a rubber Ricky dummy as her dancing partner.</p>
<p>The show provided Ball ample opportunity to display her considerable skill at clowning and <a href="Physical_comedy" title="Physical comedy">physical comedy</a>. Character development was not a major focus of early sitcoms, so little was offered about her life before the show. A few episodes mentioned that she was born in <a href="Jamestown,_New_York" title="Jamestown, New York">Jamestown, New York</a> (Lucille Ball's real-life home town), later corrected to <a href="Jamestown_West,_New_York" title="Jamestown West, New York"><i>West</i> Jamestown</a>, that she graduated from Jamestown High School, that her maiden name was "McGillicuddy" (indicating a <a href="Scotland" title="Scotland">Scottish</a> ethnicity, though she once mentioned her grandmother was Swedish), and that she met Ricky on a <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/blind_date" class="extiw" title="wikt:blind date">blind date</a>. Her family was absent, other than occasional appearances by her bird-brained mother (<a href="Kathryn_Card" title="Kathryn Card">Kathryn Card</a>), who could never get Ricky's name right. Lucy also exhibited many stereotypical female traits that were standard for comedy at the time, including being secretive about her age and true hair color, and being careless with money. She was also depicted as a devoted housewife and attentive mother.</p>

Lucy and Ricky are mountain climbing in the Alps during their 1956 European vacation.</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>Lucy's husband, Ricky Ricardo, is an up-and-coming <a href="Cuban_American" title="Cuban American">Cuban American</a> singer and bandleader with an excitable personality. His patience is frequently tested by his wife's antics. When exasperated, he often reverts to speaking rapidly in Spanish. As with Lucy, not much is revealed about his past or family. Ricky's mother (played by actress Mary Emery) appears in two episodes; in another Lucy mentions that he has five brothers. Ricky also mentions that he had been "practically raised" by his uncle Alberto (who was seen during a family visit to <a href="Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>), and that he had attended <a href="Havana_University" title="Havana University" class="mw-redirect">Havana University</a>.</p>
<p>An extended flashback segment in the 1957 episode "Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana" of <i>The Lucille Ball–Desi Arnaz Show</i> filled in numerous details of how Lucy and Ricky met and how Ricky came to the United States. The story, at least insofar as related to newspaper columnist <a href="Hedda_Hopper" title="Hedda Hopper">Hedda Hopper</a>, is that the couple met in Havana when Lucy and the Mertzes vacationed there in 1940. Despite his being a university graduate and proficient in English, Ricky is portrayed as a driver of a horse-drawn cab who waits for fares at a pier where tourists arrive by ship. Ricky is hired to serve as one of Lucy's tour guides and the two fall in love. Having coincidentally also met popular singer <a href="Rudy_Vall%C3%A9e" title="Rudy Vallée">Rudy Vallée</a> on the cruise ship, Lucy arranges an audition for Ricky who is hired to be in Vallée's orchestra thus allowing him to immigrate to the United States on the very ship on which Lucy and the Mertzes were returning. Lucy later states Ricky played for Vallée only one night before being traded to <a href="Xavier_Cugat" title="Xavier Cugat">Xavier Cugat</a>'s orchestra.</p>
<p>Lucy is usually found with her sidekick and best friend Ethel Mertz. A former model from <a href="Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="Albuquerque, New Mexico">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, Ethel tries to relive her glory days in <a href="Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a>. Ricky is more inclined to include Ethel in performances at his nightclub because, unlike Lucy, she can actually sing and dance.</p>
<p>Ethel's husband Fred served in World War I, and lived through the <a href="Great_Depression" title="Great Depression">Great Depression</a>. He is very stingy with money and an irascible no-nonsense type. However, he also shows that he can be a soft touch, especially when it comes to Little Ricky. Fred can also sing and dance and often performs duets with Ethel.</p>

<p>Many of the characters' names were after family members or close friends of Lucille Ball's; for example, Marion Strong was one of her best friends and roommate for a time in New York, and also set Lucy and Ricky up on their first date. Lillian Appleby was a teacher of Lucy's when she was in an amateur production on the stage. Pauline Lopus was a childhood friend, Fred was also her brother and grandfather's name. Lucy and Desi had a business manager by the name of Mr. Andrew Hickox, and in the first episode of season 4, called the "The Business Manager" Lucy and Ricky hire a man named Mr. Hickox.</p>

<p>Lucille Ball had come to Hollywood in 1933, when, after a successful stint as a New York model, she was chosen by <a href="Sam_Goldwyn" title="Sam Goldwyn" class="mw-redirect">Sam Goldwyn</a> to be one of sixteen <a href="Goldwyn_Girls" title="Goldwyn Girls">Goldwyn Girls</a> to co-star in the picture <i><a href="Roman_Scandals" title="Roman Scandals">Roman Scandals</a></i> with film star <a href="Eddie_Cantor" title="Eddie Cantor">Eddie Cantor</a>. Enthusiastic and hard-working Ball had been able to secure film work briefly at the <a href="Samuel_Goldwyn_Studio" title="Samuel Goldwyn Studio">Samuel Goldwyn Studio</a> and <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> and then eventually at <a href="RKO_Radio_Pictures" title="RKO Radio Pictures" class="mw-redirect">RKO Radio Pictures</a>. It was at RKO that Ball received steady film work, first as an extra and bit player, eventually working her way up to co-starring roles in feature films and starring roles in second rate <a href="B_pictures" title="B pictures" class="mw-redirect">B pictures</a>, collectively earning the nickname "Queen of the B's". During her run at RKO, Ball gained the reputation for doing physical comedy and stunts that most other actresses avoided, keeping her steadily employed. In 1940, Lucy met Desi Arnaz, a Cuban bandleader who had just come off a successful run in the 1939–40 <a href="Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> show <i><a href="Too_Many_Girls_(musical)" title="Too Many Girls (musical)">Too Many Girls</a></i>. RKO had bought the film rights to the show and cast Ball as Arnaz's love interest in the picture. The duo began a whirlwind courtship leading to their elopement to Connecticut in November 1940. Despite being madly in love, however, their careers kept them separated, with Lucy's film work keeping her anchored in Hollywood, while Desi's nightclub engagements with his orchestra kept him on the road.</p>
<p>Despite steadily working in pictures, Lucy's movie career never advanced to the level of a headlining feature-film actress; nevertheless she remained popular with movie audiences. After receiving critical acclaim for her starring role in the 1942 <a href="Damon_Runyon" title="Damon Runyon">Damon Runyon</a> film <i><a href="The_Big_Street" title="The Big Street">The Big Street</a></i> (with <a href="Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>), Ball came to the attention of <a href="MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a>, which bought out her contract. It was at MGM that Ball, who had been a blonde, <a href="Dye" title="Dye">dyed</a> her hair red to complement the Technicolor features that MGM had planned to use her in. MGM used Ball in a variety of films, but it was her work with funny man <a href="Red_Skelton" title="Red Skelton">Red Skelton</a> in the 1942 film <i><a href="DuBarry_Was_a_Lady" title="DuBarry Was a Lady">DuBarry Was a Lady</a></i> that brought Ball's physical comedy into the forefront, earning her the reputation as "that crazy redhead"<sup class="noprint Inline-Template" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Avoid_weasel_words" title="Wikipedia:Avoid weasel words" class="mw-redirect"><span title="The material in the vicinity of this tag may use weasel words or too-vague attribution. from October 2011">according to whom?</span></a></i>]</sup>. Nonetheless, Ball's striking beauty was in sharp contrast to physical antics she did in her films; thus, MGM tried to use her in an array of different film genres that did little to highlight her skills. Being difficult to cast, MGM chose not to renew her contract when it expired in 1946.</p>
<p>Ball began working as a free-lancer in films and began to explore other venues. Before and during World War II, Lucy had made several notable and successful guest appearances on several radio programs; among them <a href="Jack_Haley" title="Jack Haley">Jack Haley</a>'s radio show and bandleader <a href="Kay_Kaiser" title="Kay Kaiser" class="mw-redirect">Kay Kaiser</a>'s radio program. These appearances brought Lucy to the attention of CBS, which in 1948 enlisted Ball to star in one of two new half-hour situational comedies in development, <i><a href="Our_Miss_Brooks" title="Our Miss Brooks">Our Miss Brooks</a></i> and <i><a href="My_Favorite_Husband" title="My Favorite Husband">My Favorite Husband</a></i>. Choosing the latter, Lucy portrayed Liz Cugat (later anglicized to Cooper), the frustrated and scheming housewife of a <a href="Minneapolis" title="Minneapolis">Minneapolis</a> banker, played originally by actor <a href="Lee_Bowman" title="Lee Bowman">Lee Bowman</a> in the series pilot, and later by actor <a href="Richard_Denning" title="Richard Denning">Richard Denning</a>. Based on the novel <i>Mr. and Mrs. Cugat</i> by <a href="Isabel_Scott_Rorick" title="Isabel Scott Rorick">Isabel Scott Rorick</a>, <i>My Favorite Husband</i> was produced by <a href="Jess_Oppenheimer" title="Jess Oppenheimer">Jess Oppenheimer</a>, written by Oppenheimer, plus scribes <a href="Madelyn_Pugh" title="Madelyn Pugh">Madelyn Pugh</a> and <a href="Bob_Carroll,_Jr." title="Bob Carroll, Jr.">Bob Carroll, Jr.</a>. Premiering on July 23, 1948 and sponsored by <a href="General_Foods" title="General Foods">General Foods</a>, <i>Husband</i> became a hit for CBS. During the run of the radio program Lucy appeared in two feature films with Bob Hope, <i><a href="Sorrowful_Jones" title="Sorrowful Jones">Sorrowful Jones</a></i> in 1949, and <i><a href="Fancy_Pants_(film)" title="Fancy Pants (film)">Fancy Pants</a></i> in 1950. Both films were box office and critical successes, further cementing Ball's reputation as a top notch first-rate comedienne. They also showed her continuing popularity with audiences, enticing CBS to further use her skills.</p>
<p>In 1950, CBS asked Ball to take <i>My Favorite Husband</i> to television with co-star <a href="Richard_Denning" title="Richard Denning">Richard Denning</a>. She, however, saw a television show as a great opportunity to work with Desi as it would keep them both in Hollywood, and perhaps save their shaky marriage. Lucy insisted that Desi play her husband, much to the dismay of CBS, which was reluctant because Arnaz was Cuban. Network executives believed that audiences would not believe the marriage between an all-American girl and a Latin man. To prove CBS wrong, the couple developed a <a href="Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act, written by Carroll and Pugh, that they took on the road with Arnaz's orchestra. The act was a hit and convinced CBS executive <a href="Harry_Ackerman" title="Harry Ackerman">Harry Ackerman</a> that a Ball-Arnaz pairing would be a worthwhile venture. At the same time, rival networks <a href="NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>, <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a>, and <a href="DuMont_Television_Network" title="DuMont Television Network">DuMont</a> were showing interest in a Ball-Arnaz series, which Ackerman used to convince CBS to sign the duo. A pilot was ordered and kinescoped in Hollywood in March 1951, which coincided with Lucy's first pregnancy, and the ending of <i>Husband</i>, which aired its last radio show on March 31, 1951. Ball and Arnaz used the same radio team of Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll to create the television series that was named <i>I Love Lucy</i>. After showing the pilot to several advertising agencies, at first with not much luck, CBS was able to sell the series to the <a href="../../w/index-title=Milton_Biow&action=edit&redlink=1.php.html" class="new" title="Milton Biow (page does not exist)">Milton Biow</a> agency, which was able to convince one of their clients, cigarette giant <a href="Philip_Morris_USA" title="Philip Morris USA">Philip Morris</a>, to sponsor the show.</p>

<p>During the spring and summer of 1951, <i>I Love Lucy</i> moved into production. Oppenheimer, Pugh, and Carroll began fine-tuning the premise of the show and writing the series' first scripts. The trio had the good graces of having a backlog of storylines from <i>My Favorite Husband</i> to adapt for use on television. In addition, the series' ensemble cast and crew were assembled. Desi Arnaz retained his orchestra, which was used in the series musical numbers and to score the show's background and transitional music. Arnaz's childhood friend <a href="Marco_Rizo" title="Marco Rizo">Marco Rizo</a> arranged the music and played the piano for the show, while <a href="Wilbur_Hatch" title="Wilbur Hatch">Wilbur Hatch</a> was used to conduct the orchestra. Two problems arose, however, after Philip Morris signed on to sponsor the show, that would ultimately change the fate of <i>I Love Lucy</i>.</p>

<p>Lucy and Desi had originally decided that the series would air on a biweekly basis much like <i><a href="The_George_Burns_and_Gracie_Allen_Show" title="The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show" class="mw-redirect">The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show</a></i>. Philip Morris, however, was insistent that the show air weekly, thus diminishing the possibility of Lucy continuing her film career alongside a television show. Another problem lay in the fact that Philip Morris wanted the series to originate from New York rather than Hollywood. At the time, most television shows were produced from New York with live broadcasts of the show airing for eastern and Midwest audiences. West coast viewers were able to view live programs only through low-quality <a href="Kinescope" title="Kinescope">kinescopes</a>, which derived their images by using a 35&#160;mm or <a href="16_mm" title="16 mm" class="mw-redirect">16 mm</a> film camera to record the show off a closed-circuit television monitor. As <a href="Videotape" title="Videotape">videotape</a> had not yet been developed, (and would not be until the mid-fifties), kinescopes were the only practical, and affordable, means to allow a live show to reach television markets on the west coast. Complicating matters was that kinescopes were not available for immediate re-broadcast as in 1951 no coast-to-coast cable system was yet in service. Shows had to be sent to Hollywood, which delayed their airings for west coast audiences by nearly a week. The process operated in the reverse for the few programs that originated live in Hollywood, such as <i>Burns and Allen</i> and <i><a href="The_Ed_Wynn_Show" title="The Ed Wynn Show" class="mw-redirect">The Ed Wynn Show</a></i>, thus making blurry kinescopes of these shows the only available print for eastern audiences. Most sponsors, including Philip Morris, found this to be undesirable as most of the television audience lived east of the Mississippi at the time. Owing to the impending birth of their first child, both Lucy and Desi insisted on staying in <a href="Hollywood,_Los_Angeles,_California" title="Hollywood, Los Angeles, California" class="mw-redirect">Hollywood</a> and producing the show on film, something a few Hollywood-based series had begun doing. Both CBS and Philip Morris initially balked at the idea, because of the higher cost that filming the show would incur, yet acquiesced only after the pair offered to take a one-thousand-dollar a week pay cut in order to cover the additional expense. In exchange, Lucy and Desi demanded, and were given, the majority ownership in the <i>I Love Lucy</i> films. Putting the show on film, however, would require that Lucy and Desi become responsible for producing the series themselves. Union agreements at the time stipulated that any production filmed in a studio use film studio employees. CBS staff were television and radio employees and thus fell under different union agreements. Thus, Arnaz reorganized the company he created to manage his orchestra bookings and used it as the corporation that would produce the <i>I Love Lucy</i> shows. Named after their ranch in <a href="Chatsworth,_California" title="Chatsworth, California" class="mw-redirect">Chatsworth, California</a>, the company was named <a href="Desilu" title="Desilu" class="mw-redirect">Desilu</a>.</p>
<p>Though some television series were already being filmed in Hollywood, most used the <a href="Single-camera_setup" title="Single-camera setup">single-camera</a> format familiar from movies, with a laugh track added to comedies to simulate audience response. Arnaz and Jess Oppenheimer decided, however, that Lucy needed to work in front of an audience to create the kind of comic energy she had displayed on radio. The idea of a film studio that could accommodate an audience was a new one for the time, as fire laws made it difficult to allow an audience in a studio. Arnaz and Oppenheimer were lucky enough to find the financially struggling <a href="General_Service_Studios" title="General Service Studios" class="mw-redirect">General Service Studios</a> located on Las Palmas Avenue in Hollywood. Studio owner Jimmy Nasser was eager to accommodate the Desilu company and allowed them, with financial backing of CBS, to renovate two of his studios so that they could accommodate an audience and be in compliance with local fire laws.</p>

<p>Another component to filming the show came when it was decided to use three 35&#160;mm film cameras to simultaneously film the show. The idea had been pioneered by <a href="Ralph_Edwards" title="Ralph Edwards">Ralph Edwards</a> on the game show <i><a href="Truth_or_Consequences" title="Truth or Consequences">Truth or Consequences</a></i>, and had subsequently been used on <i><a href="Amos_'n'_Andy" title="Amos 'n' Andy">Amos 'n' Andy</a></i> as a way to save money, though <i>Amos n' Andy</i> did not use an audience. Edwards's assistant Al Simon was hired by Desilu to help perfect the new technique for the series. The process lent itself to the <i>Lucy</i> production as it eliminated the problem of requiring an audience to view and react to a scene three or four times in order for all necessary shots to be filmed. Multiple cameras would also allow scenes to be performed in sequence, as a play would be, which was unusual at the time for filmed series. Retakes were rare and dialogue mistakes were often played off for the sake of continuity. Lucy and Desi enlisted the services of <a href="Karl_Freund" title="Karl Freund">Karl Freund</a>, an <a href="Academy_Award" title="Academy Award">Academy Award</a>-winning cinematographer of such films as <i><a href="Metropolis_(film)" title="Metropolis (film)">Metropolis</a></i> (1927), <i><a href="Dracula" title="Dracula">Dracula</a></i> (1931), and <i><a href="The_Good_Earth_(film)" title="The Good Earth (film)">The Good Earth</a></i> (1937), as well as director of <i><a href="The_Mummy_(1932_film)" title="The Mummy (1932 film)">The Mummy</a></i> (1932), to be the series <a href="Cinematographer" title="Cinematographer">cinematographer</a>. Although at first Freund did not want anything to do with television, it was the personal plea of both Lucy and Desi that convinced Freund to take the job. Freund was instrumental in developing a way to uniformly light the set so that each of the three cameras would pick up the same quality of image.</p>
<p>As mentioned, audience reactions were live, thus creating a far more authentic laugh than the "<a href="Laugh_track" title="Laugh track">canned laughter</a>" used on most filmed sitcoms of the time. Regular audience members were sometimes heard from episode to episode, and Arnaz's distinctive laugh could be heard in the background during scenes in which he did not perform.</p>
<p><i>I Love Lucy'</i>s pioneering use of <a href="Multicamera_setup" title="Multicamera setup" class="mw-redirect">three cameras</a> led to it becoming the standard technique for the production of most sitcoms filmed in front of an audience, though single-camera remained the technique of choice for sitcoms that did not use audiences. The process resulted in a much sharper quality of show in contrast to blurry kinescopes. This led to an unexpected benefit for Desilu during the series's second season when it was discovered that Lucy was pregnant. Not being able to fulfill the show's 39-episode commitment, both Desi and Jess Oppenheimer decided to rebroadcast popular episodes of the series's first season to help give Lucy the necessary rest she needed after she gave birth, effectively allowing fewer episodes to be filmed that season. Unexpectedly the rebroadcasts proved to be ratings winners, effectively giving birth to the <a href="Rerun" title="Rerun">rerun</a>, which would later lead to the profitable development of the rerun syndication market.</p>
<p><a href="Desilu_Productions" title="Desilu Productions">Desilu Productions</a>, jointly owned by Ball and Arnaz, would gradually expand to produce and lease studio space for many other shows. For seasons 1 and 2 (1951–1953), Desilu rented space and filmed <i>I Love Lucy</i> at General Service Studios, which eventually became known as <a href="Hollywood_Center_Studios" title="Hollywood Center Studios">Hollywood Center Studios</a>. In 1953, it leased the Motion Picture Center at 846 Cahuenga Blvd. in Hollywood, and renamed it Desilu Studios to shoot seasons 3–6 (1953–1957) of <i>I Love Lucy</i>. After 1956, it became known as <i>Desilu-Cahuenga Studios</i> to avoid confusion with other acquired Desilu locations. In an effort to keep up with the studio's growth, and need for additional sound stages, Desi and Lucy purchased RKO Radio Pictures from <a href="General_Tire" title="General Tire">General Tire</a> in 1957 for over six million dollars, effectively owning the studio where they had started as contract players. Desilu acquired RKO's two studios located on Gower Street in Hollywood, and in <a href="Culver_City" title="Culver City" class="mw-redirect">Culver City</a>, along with the Culver City back lot nicknamed "<a href="RKO_Forty_Acres" title="RKO Forty Acres">Forty Acres</a>". The sale was achieved by the duo selling their ownership of the once thought worthless <i>I Love Lucy</i> films back to CBS for over four million dollars. In 1962, two years after their marriage dissolved, Lucy bought out Desi's shares of Desilu, becoming the studio's sole owner. She eventually sold off Desilu in 1967 to <a href="Gulf+Western" title="Gulf+Western">Gulf+Western</a>, owners of <a href="Paramount_Pictures" title="Paramount Pictures">Paramount Pictures</a>. After the sale, Desilu-Cahuenga became a private production company and was known as <a href="Ren-Mar_Studios" title="Ren-Mar Studios">Ren-Mar Studios</a> till 2010, when it was acquired by the <a href="Red_Digital_Cinema_Camera_Company" title="Red Digital Cinema Camera Company">Red Digital Cinema Camera Company</a> and renamed Red Studios – Hollywood. The RKO-Desilu Studio on Gower Street is now owned by Paramount while the Culver City studio has become the independently owned <a href="Culver_Studios" title="Culver Studios">Culver Studios</a>. The "Forty Acres" backlot was sold off by Gulf+Western in 1976 and redeveloped in the 1980s into an industrial tract.<sup id="cite_ref-Sanders_5-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sanders-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>As with <i>My Favorite Husband</i>, <i>Lucy</i> writers decided that the Ricardos needed an older couple to play off of. While doing <i>Husband</i>, veteran character actors Gale Gordon and Bea Benaderet had played Rudolph and Iris Atterbury, an older, more financially stable couple as Mr. Atterbury was George Cooper's (Lucy's radio husband's) boss. Ball had initially wanted both actors to reprise their roles on television, however, both were unavailable at the time the show went into production as Benaderet was already playing Blanche Morton on <i>Burns and Allen</i>, and Gordon was under contract by CBS to play Mr. Conklin on the radio and television versions of <i><a href="Our_Miss_Brooks" title="Our Miss Brooks">Our Miss Brooks</a></i>.</p>

<p>Casting the Mertzes, as they were now called (the surname taken from a doctor <i>Lucy</i> scribe Madelyn Pugh knew as a child in Indianapolis), proved to be a challenge. Ball had initially wanted character actor <a href="James_Gleason" title="James Gleason">James Gleason</a>, with whom she appeared in <a href="Columbia_Pictures" title="Columbia Pictures">Columbia Pictures</a> 1949 movie <i><a href="Miss_Grant_Takes_Richmond" title="Miss Grant Takes Richmond">Miss Grant Takes Richmond</a></i>, to play Fred Mertz. However, Gleason wanted nearly $3,500 per episode to play the role, a price that was far too steep. Sixty-four-year-old Bill Frawley, a seasoned vaudevillian and movie character actor with nearly 100 film credits to his name, was a long shot to play Fred Mertz and only came into consideration after he telephoned Ball personally to ask if there was a role for him on her new show. Ball, who had only briefly known Frawley from her days at <a href="RKO" title="RKO" class="mw-redirect">RKO</a>, suggested him to both Arnaz and CBS. The network balked at the idea of Frawley, fearing that his excessive drinking—which was well known in Hollywood—would interfere with his doing a live show. Arnaz nonetheless liked Frawley and lobbied hard for him to have the role, even to the point of having Lucy scribes re-tailor the role of Fred Mertz to be a less financially successful and more curmudgeonly (in contrast to Gale Gordon's Mr. Atterbury) character to fit Frawley's persona. CBS relented only after Arnaz contractually bound Frawley to complete sobriety during the production of the show, and reportedly told the veteran actor that if he ever appeared on-set more than once in an intoxicated state he would be fired. Not once during <i>Lucy'</i>s nine seasons did Frawley's drinking ever interfere with his performance, and over time Arnaz became one of Frawley's few close friends.</p>

<p>Casting the Ethel Mertz character was also some work. One choice was actress <a href="Barbara_Pepper" title="Barbara Pepper">Barbara Pepper</a>, who was a close friend of Lucy's. The two had a long history together, as Pepper had been of the Goldwyn Girls who came to Hollywood with Lucy in 1933. Pepper was favored by Lucy herself, however, CBS refused on the grounds that Pepper suffered from a drinking problem that was far more severe than Frawley's. Nonetheless Pepper did appear in several bit parts during the run of the show. <a href="Vivian_Vance" title="Vivian Vance">Vivian Vance</a> became a consideration on the recommendation of <i>Lucy</i> director Marc Daniels. Daniels had worked with Vance in New York on Broadway in the early 1940s. Vance had already been a successful stage star performing on Broadway for nearly 20 years in variety of plays and in addition, after relocating to Hollywood in the late 1940s, had two film roles to her credit. Nonetheless, by 1951, she was still a relatively unknown actress in Hollywood. Vance was performing in a revival of the play <i><a href="The_Voice_of_the_Turtle_(play)" title="The Voice of the Turtle (play)">The Voice of the Turtle</a></i> in <a href="La_Jolla,_California" title="La Jolla, California" class="mw-redirect">La Jolla, California</a>. Arnaz and <a href="Jess_Oppenheimer" title="Jess Oppenheimer">Jess Oppenheimer</a> went to see her in the play and hired her on the spot. Vance was reluctant about giving up her film and stage work for a television show, yet was convinced by Daniels that it would be a big break in her career. Ball, however, had many misgivings about hiring Vance, who was younger and far more attractive than the concept of Ethel as an older, somewhat homely woman. Ball was also a believer in the Hollywood adage at the time that there should be only one pretty woman on the set and Ball, being the star of the show, was it. Arnaz, however, was impressed by Vance's work and hired her. The decision was then made to dress Vance in frumpier clothing to tone down her attractiveness. Ball and Vance's relationship during the series' early beginnings were lukewarm to say the least. Eventually realizing that Vance was no threat and was very professional, Ball began to warm to her. In 1954, Vance would become the first actress to win an <a href="Emmy_Award" title="Emmy Award">Emmy Award</a> for <i>Outstanding Supporting Actress</i>. Vance and Ball would develop a lifelong close friendship. Ball would go on to ask Vance to co-star in Ball's new series <i><a href="The_Lucy_Show" title="The Lucy Show">The Lucy Show</a></i> after the end of <i>I Love Lucy</i>.</p>
<p>Vance and Frawley's off-screen relationship was less successful. In spite of this, they were always professional and exhibited exceptional chemistry while performing on the show. In fact, their acrimonious personal relationship may have helped their onscreen marriage be that much funnier. Frawley derisively described Vance's appearance as "a sack of doorknobs."<sup id="cite_ref-6" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-6"><span>[</span>6<span>]</span></a></sup> It was reported that Vance, who was 22 years younger than Frawley, was not really keen on the idea that her character Ethel was married to a man that was old enough to be her father. Vance also complained that Frawley's song-and-dance skills were not what they once were. Frawley and Vance would have an adversarial relationship during the entire run of the show.<sup id="cite_ref-Sanders_5-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-Sanders-5"><span>[</span>5<span>]</span></a></sup></p>

<p>In 1957, <i>I Love Lucy</i> was re-tailored into an hour-long show originally titled <i>The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show</i> that was to be part of an anthology series called the <i><a href="Westinghouse_Desilu_Playhouse" title="Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse">Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse</a></i>. The hour-long <i>Lucy-Desi</i> show was to alternate on a monthly basis with other hour long <i>Playhouse</i> shows. The new series put a much heavier emphasis on big name guest stars as being part of the plot and although the Mertz characters continued into the new series, their roles became somewhat diminished. Although a lighter workload was welcomed by Frawley, Vance came to somewhat resent the change. Arnaz, in an effort to please Vance, for whom he had much respect, proposed doing a spin-off from <i>I Love Lucy</i> called <i>The Mertzes</i> to star Vivian Vance and William Frawley. Seeing a lucrative opportunity and the chance to star in his own show, Frawley was enthused. Vance, however, declined for a number of reasons, the biggest factor being that she felt she and Frawley could barely work together on the ensemble show they were doing at the time, so it would be much less likely the two could work together on their <i>own</i> series. Vance also felt that the Mertz characters would not be as successful without the Ricardos to play off of, and despite being her biggest success, she was becoming interested in doing more glamorous roles instead of playing Ethel. In fact, during the thirteen episode run of the <i>Lucy-Desi</i> hour-long shows, Vance was given a lot more latitude to look more attractive as Ethel Mertz, something she had been denied during the run of the <i>I Love Lucy</i> episodes. Frawley's resentment of Vance intensified after she declined to do the spin-off show and the two rarely talked to each other outside of their characters' dialogue with one another.</p>
<p>Years later, when Vance was on <i><a href="The_Lucy_Show" title="The Lucy Show">The Lucy Show</a></i> and Frawley was on <i><a href="My_Three_Sons" title="My Three Sons">My Three Sons</a></i>, Frawley would often bribe the eponymous sons to play practical jokes on Vance when she was rehearsing, as the two shows filmed on neighboring soundstages.</p>

<p>Just before filming the show, Lucy and Desi learned that Lucy was once again pregnant (after multiple miscarriages earlier in their marriage) with their first child, <a href="Lucie_Arnaz" title="Lucie Arnaz">Lucie Arnaz</a>. They actually filmed the original pilot while Lucy was "showing", but did not include any references to the pregnancy in the episode.

<p>CBS would not allow <i>I Love Lucy</i> to use the word "<a href="Pregnant" title="Pregnant" class="mw-redirect">pregnant</a>", so "expecting" was used instead.<sup id="cite_ref-turningpoints_8-0" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-turningpoints-8"><span>[</span>8<span>]</span></a></sup> The episode "Lucy Is Enceinte" first aired on December 8, 1952 ("enceinte" being French for "expecting" or "pregnant"). One week later, on December 15, 1952, the episode titled "Pregnant Women Are Unpredictable" was aired (although the show never displayed episode titles on the air). The episode in which Lucy gives birth, "<a href="Lucy_Goes_to_the_Hospital" title="Lucy Goes to the Hospital">Lucy Goes to the Hospital</a>", first aired on January 19, 1953. To increase the publicity of this episode, the original air date was chosen to coincide with Lucille Ball's real-life delivery of Desi, Jr. by <a href="Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">Caesarean section</a>.<sup id="cite_ref-birthofamemo_4-1" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-birthofamemo-4"><span>[</span>4<span>]</span></a></sup> "Lucy Goes to the Hospital" was watched by more people than any other television program up to that time, with 71.7% of all American television sets tuned in, topping the 67.7 rating for Dwight Eisenhower's inauguration coverage the following morning.</p>
<p>Unlike some programs that <a href="Soap_Opera_Rapid_Aging_Syndrome" title="Soap Opera Rapid Aging Syndrome">advance the age of a newborn over a short period of time</a>, <i>I Love Lucy</i> allowed the Little Ricky character to grow up in real time. America saw Little Ricky as an infant in the 1952–53 season, a toddler from 1953 to 1956, and finally a young school-age boy from 1956 to 1960. However, five actors played the role, two sets of twins and later <a href="Keith_Thibodeaux" title="Keith Thibodeaux">Keith Thibodeaux</a>. (In the <a href="Lucy_and_Superman" title="Lucy and Superman">Superman</a> episode, Little Ricky is mentioned as five years old but it had been only four years since the birth-of-Little-Ricky episode.)</p>
<p><a href="Jess_Oppenheimer" title="Jess Oppenheimer">Jess Oppenheimer</a> stated in his autobiography that deciding the sex of the Ricardo child was initially problematic. <i>Lucy</i> scribes initially wanted the Ricardos to have a boy, feeling that a boy would allow for more comical plot lines. Still unconvinced, Oppenheimer asked Desi what he wanted: Desi replied that he wanted a boy because this might be his only chance to have a son with Lucy. From then on, no matter what the sex of Lucille Ball's real baby was, Lucy Ricardo would have a boy.</p>

<p>The opening familiar to most viewers, featuring the credits superimposed over a "heart on satin" image, was created specifically for the 1959–67 CBS daytime network rebroadcasts, and subsequent syndication. As originally broadcast, the episodes opened with animated matchstick figures of Arnaz and Ball making reference to whoever the particular episode's sponsor was. These sequences were created by the animation team of <a href="Bill_Hanna" title="Bill Hanna" class="mw-redirect">Bill Hanna</a> and <a href="Joe_Barbera" title="Joe Barbera" class="mw-redirect">Joe Barbera</a>, who declined screen credit because they were technically under exclusive contract to <a href="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer" title="Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer">MGM</a> at the time.</p>
<p>The original sponsor was cigarette maker <a href="Philip_Morris_USA" title="Philip Morris USA">Philip Morris</a>, so the program opened with a cartoon of Lucy and Ricky climbing down a pack of Philip Morris cigarettes. In the early episodes, Lucy and Ricky, as well as Ethel and Fred on occasion, were shown smoking Philip Morris cigarettes. Lucy even went so far as to parody <a href="Johnny_Roventini" title="Johnny Roventini">Johnny Roventini</a>'s image as the Philip Morris "bellhop" in the May 5, 1952, episode, "Lucy Does a TV Commercial". Since the original sponsor references were no longer appropriate when the shows went into syndication, a new opening was needed, which resulted in the classic "heart on satin" opening. Other sponsors, whose products appeared during the original openings, were <a href="Procter_&_Gamble" title="Procter &amp; Gamble">Procter &amp; Gamble</a> for <a href="Cheer_(brand)" title="Cheer (brand)">Cheer</a> and Lilt Home Permanent (1954–57), <a href="General_Foods" title="General Foods">General Foods</a> for <a href="Sanka" title="Sanka">Sanka</a> (1955–57), <a href="Ford_Motor_Company" title="Ford Motor Company">Ford Motor Company</a> (1957–58), and <a href="Westinghouse_Electric_(1886)" title="Westinghouse Electric (1886)">Westinghouse</a> company (1958–60).</p>
<p>The original openings, with the sponsor names edited out, were revived on <a href="TV_Land" title="TV Land">TV Land</a> showings, with a TV Land logo superimposed to obscure the original sponsor's logo. However, this has led some people to believe that the restored introduction was created specifically for TV Land as an example of <a href="Kitsch" title="Kitsch">kitsch</a>.</p>
<p>The animated openings, along with the middle commercial introductory animations, are included, fully restored, in the DVDs.</p>

<p>There was some thought about creating an <i>I Love Lucy</i> radio show to run in conjuncture with the television series as was being done at the time with the CBS hit show <i>Our Miss Brooks</i>. On February 27, 1952, a sample <i>I Love Lucy</i> radio show was produced, but it never aired. This was a pilot episode, created by editing the soundtrack of the television episode "Breaking the Lease", with added Arnaz narration. It included commercials for <a href="Philip_Morris_USA" title="Philip Morris USA">Philip Morris</a>, which sponsored the television series. While it never aired on radio at the time in the 1950s (Philip Morris eventually sponsored a radio edition of <i><a href="My_Little_Margie" title="My Little Margie">My Little Margie</a></i> instead), copies of this radio pilot episode have been circulating among "old time radio" collectors for years, and this radio pilot episode has aired in more recent decades on numerous local radio stations that air some "old time radio" programming.</p>

Later episodes take the Ricardos and the Mertzes to Hollywood for Ricky to shoot a movie, and to Europe, when Ricky and his band tour the continent. There is also a trip to Miami Beach for the two couples, with a side trip to Ricky's homeland of Cuba. Eventually, like millions of other Americans in the late 1950s, the friends move to the suburbs, in this case, to <a href="Westport,_Connecticut" title="Westport, Connecticut">Westport, Connecticut</a>.</p>
<p>Some especially memorable episodes:</p>

Lucy becomes progressively drunker throughout rehearsal, but gamely keeps on pitching the product, eventually leading to a completely flubbed live performance for "this stuff."

Then Superman says, "You mean to tell me that you've been married to her for fifteen years?" Ricky answers, "Yeah, fifteen years." Superman replies, "And they call <i>me</i> superman!"

Fearing that the actor will recognize her, she puts on a disguise that includes a putty nose, which catches on fire when she lights a cigarette. This episode was reportedly Lucille Ball's favorite episode. (original air date Feb 7, 1955)</li>

<p>Arnaz and Ball capitalized on the series' popularity by starring in <a href="Vincente_Minnelli" title="Vincente Minnelli">Vincente Minnelli</a>'s 1954 film <i><a href="The_Long,_Long_Trailer" title="The Long, Long Trailer">The Long, Long Trailer</a></i> as Tracy and Nicky Collini, two characters very similar to Lucy and Ricky. Also during this time, <a href="Desilu" title="Desilu" class="mw-redirect">Desilu</a> produced a <a href="I_Love_Lucy_(film)" title="I Love Lucy (film)">feature film version</a> of the show in 1953, consisting of three first-season episodes edited together: "The Benefit", "Breaking the Lease" and "The Ballet". New scenes featuring the cast were filmed and put between the episodes to tie them into one cohesive story. <a href="MGM" title="MGM" class="mw-redirect">MGM</a>, however, demanded the <a href="I_Love_Lucy_(film)" title="I Love Lucy (film)"><i>I Love Lucy</i> movie</a> be shelved because they felt it would diminish interest in <i>The Long, Long Trailer</i>. Although <i>I Love Lucy</i> was never theatrically released and had been forgotten, it has since been found and has been released on the bonus disc in the Complete Series collection.</p>
<p>In 1956 Lucy and Desi starred in the feature film <i><a href="Forever,_Darling" title="Forever, Darling">Forever, Darling</a></i> with <a href="James_Mason" title="James Mason">James Mason</a>.</p>

<p>After the conclusion of the sixth season of <i>I Love Lucy</i>, the Arnazes decided to cut down on the number of episodes that were filmed. Instead, they extended <i>I Love Lucy</i> to 60 minutes, with a guest star each episode. They renamed the show <i><a href="The_Lucy%E2%80%93Desi_Comedy_Hour" title="The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour">The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show</a></i>, also known as <i><a href="The_Lucy-Desi_Comedy_Hour" title="The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour" class="mw-redirect">The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour</a></i>. Thirteen hour-long episodes aired from 1957 to 1960. The main cast, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz, Vivian Vance, William Frawley and Keith Thibodeaux were all in the show. <i>The Lucy-Desi Comedy Hour</i> is available on DVD, released as <i>I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons 7, 8, &amp; 9</i>. On March 2, Desi's birthday, 1960, the day after the last hour-long episode was filmed, Lucille Ball filed for divorce from Desi Arnaz. It made that playful, yet passionate kiss at the end of the final episode, which aired April 1, "Lucy Meets the Moustache", all the more poignant, as the world already knew that this storied Hollywood marriage was all but over, and also lent extra meaning to the use of the song "That's All" in that episode.</p>
<p>As mentioned Vance and Frawley were offered a chance to take their characters to their own spin-off series. Frawley was willing, but Vance refused to ever work with Frawley again since the two did not get along. Frawley did appear once more with Lucille Ball — in an episode of <i><a href="The_Lucy_Show" title="The Lucy Show">The Lucy Show</a></i> in 1965, which did not include Vance (who by then had ceased to be a regular on that show). However, this was his last screen appearance with his longtime friend. He died in Hollywood on March 3, 1966, of a heart attack at age 79.</p>
<p>In 1962, Ball began a six-year run with <i>The Lucy Show</i>, followed immediately in 1968 by six more years on yet another sitcom, <i><a href="Here's_Lucy" title="Here's Lucy">Here's Lucy</a></i>, finally ending her long run as a CBS sitcom star in 1974. Both <i>The Lucy Show</i> and <i>Here's Lucy</i> are notable for having Vance as recurring characters named <i>Viv</i> (Vivian Bagley Bunson on <i>The Lucy Show</i> and Vivian Jones on <i>Here's Lucy</i>), so named because she was tired of being recognized on the street and addressed as <i>Ethel</i>. Vance was a regular during the first three seasons of <i>The Lucy Show</i> but continued to make guest appearances through the years on <i>The Lucy Show</i>, and on <i>Here's Lucy</i>. In 1977, Vance and Ball were reunited one last time in the CBS special, <i>Lucy Calls the President</i>,<sup id="cite_ref-15" class="reference"><a href="#cite_note-15"><span>[</span>15<span>]</span></a></sup> which co-starred <a href="Gale_Gordon" title="Gale Gordon">Gale Gordon</a>.</p>
<p>In 1986, Ball tried another sitcom, <i><a href="Life_with_Lucy" title="Life with Lucy">Life with Lucy</a></i>. The series aired on <a href="American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> for eight episodes before being canceled owing to low ratings. However, the show debuted to very high ratings, landing in Nielsen's Top 20 for that week.</p>
<p><i>I Love Lucy</i> has remained perennially popular. For instance, it was one of the first programs made in the USA seen on <a href="British_television" title="British television" class="mw-redirect">British television</a>, which became more open to commerce with the launch of <a href="ITV" title="ITV" class="mw-redirect">ITV</a>, a commercial network that aired the series, in September 1955. As of July 2007, it remains the longest-running program to air continuously in the Los Angeles area, almost 50 years after production ended. However, the series is currently aired on <a href="KTTV" title="KTTV">KTTV</a> on weekends and now <a href="KCOP" title="KCOP" class="mw-redirect">KCOP</a> on weekdays because both stations are a <a href="Duopoly" title="Duopoly">duopoly</a>, of which KTTV had given up the CBS affiliation several months before <i>I Love Lucy</i> premiered.<sup class="Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="Wikipedia_Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources from February 2007">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> In the US, reruns have aired nationally on <a href="TBS_(TV_channel)" title="TBS (TV channel)">TBS</a> (1980s–1990s), <a href="Nick_at_Nite" title="Nick at Nite">Nick at Nite</a> (1994–2001) and <a href="TV_Land" title="TV Land">TV Land</a> (2001–2008) in addition to local channels. TV Land ended its run of the series by giving viewers the opportunity to vote on the show's top 25 greatest episodes of all-time on December 31, 2008 on the network's website. This is particularly notable because, unlike some shows to which a cable channel is given exclusive rights to maximize ratings, <i>Lucy</i> has been consistently—and successfully—broadcast on multiple channels simultaneously. <a href="Hallmark_Channel" title="Hallmark Channel">Hallmark Channel</a> is now the home for I Love Lucy in the United States, having moved to the network on January 2, 2009, while the national version of <a href="Weigel_Broadcasting" title="Weigel Broadcasting">Weigel Broadcasting</a>'s <a href="Me-TV" title="Me-TV">Me-TV</a> <a href="Digital_subchannel" title="Digital subchannel">digital subchannel</a> network has carried the program since its debut in December 15, 2010, depending on the market (in markets where another station holds the rights, <i>The Lucy Show</i> is substituted).

<p>Beginning in the summer of 2001, Columbia House Television began releasing <i>I Love Lucy</i> on DVD in chronological order. They began that summer with the pilot and the first three episodes on a single DVD. Every six weeks, another volume of four episodes would be released on DVD in chronological order. During the summer of 2002, each DVD would contain between five and seven episodes on a single DVD. They continued to release the series very slowly and would not even begin to release any season 2 episodes until the middle of 2002. By the spring of 2003, the third season on DVD began to be released with about six episodes released every six weeks to mail order subscribers. All these DVDs have the identical features as the DVDs eventually released in the season box sets in retail.</p>
<p>By the fall of 2003, season four episodes began to be offered by mail. By the spring of 2004 season five DVDs with about six episodes each began to be released gradually. Columbia House ended the distribution of these mail order DVDs in the Winter of 2005. They began releasing complete season sets in the Summer of 2004 every few months. They stated that Columbia House Subscribers would get these episodes through mail before releasing any box sets with the same episodes. They finally ended gradual subscriptions in 2005, several months before season 5 became available in retail. Columbia House then began to make season box sets available instead of these single volumes.</p>
<p><a href="CBS_Home_Entertainment" title="CBS Home Entertainment">CBS DVD</a> (distributed by <a href="Paramount_Home_Entertainment" title="Paramount Home Entertainment" class="mw-redirect">Paramount</a>) has released all six seasons of <i>I Love Lucy</i> on DVD in <a href="DVD_region_code" title="DVD region code">Region 1</a>, as well as all 13 episodes of <i>The Lucy and Desi Comedy Hour</i> (as <i>I Love Lucy: The Final Seasons – 7, 8, &amp; 9</i>). Bonus features include rare on-set color footage and the "Desilu/Westinghouse" promotional film, as well as deleted scenes, original openings and interstitials (before they were altered or replaced for syndication) and on-air flubs. These DVDs offered identical features and identical content to the mail order single sets formerly available until 2005.</p>

<p>The DVD releases feature the syndicated heart opening, and offer the original broadcast openings as bonus features. Season 6 allows viewers to choose whether to watch the episodes with the original opening or the syndicated opening. The TV Land openings are not on these DVDs.</p>
<p>Initially, the first season was offered in volumes, with four episodes per disc. After the success of releasing seasons 2, 3, and 4 in slimpacks, the first season was re-released as a seven disc set, requiring new discs to be mastered and printed to include more episodes per disc so there would be fewer discs in the set. The individual volume discs for the first season are still in print, but are rare for lack of shelf space and because the slimpacks are more popular.</p>
<p>Episodes feature English closed-captioning, but only Spanish subtitles.</p>
<p>In Australia, The first three season were finally released in Region 4 on August 3, 2010 by CBS, distributed by Paramount. Season 1 includes 'The Pilot and all 35 Season 1' episodes in a 7 disc set. Season 2 includes 'all 31 Season 2' episodes in a 5 disc set. Season 3 includes 'All 31 Season 3' episodes in a 5 disc set. Season 2 and 3 are in a slimline pack. All three seasons have been 'Magnificently Restored and Digitally Remastered'. All episodes appear in order of their original air dates and it states that some episodes may be edited from their original network versions. <i>I Love Lucy</i> still shows on television but there are no new shows.</p>
