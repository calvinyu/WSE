\section{Introduction}
As search engines are playing an increasingly important role, the expectations of search engines also increase. The historic purpose of search engines is finding relevant documents on the Internet, but nowadays this is far from enough.

Many advanced features are being incorporated into search engines, among which there are two interesting ones: query suggestion and instant search. Query suggestion is useful in two ways: First, users do not have to input the entire query and can choose from suggestions. Second, suggestions can provide a general idea about what users want to search when they are not sure.

Instant search perfectly complements query suggestion. With instant search, users can not only see the suggested ``query'', but also searching results, which allow users to be informed of what they are looking for, and thus allow them to refine their query based on retrieved results. Using this two techniques, we provide a more interactive search engine. And with rapid feedback, users can organize their queries more accurately and get more precise results.

This project implements a search engine that adopt this new interaction mode. In the indexing time, our search engine mines the Wikipedia corpus provided in the course assignments and store words and frequencies into Trie and the frequency of n-grams into suffix tree. In the serve time, it also accumulates the users' queries into Trie. For any partial query (prefix or words), our search engine finds most likely completion from these data structures and then recommends a list of relevant queries to users' input.
Meanwhile, the results for the most probable query from the recommendation list along with document snippets are served instantly. All interactions are Ajax-based and no static elements are updated for queries, therefore, the traffic is minimized.

Instant search is first used in Google, and now adopted by some other popular search engines (e.g. Baidu). A lot of our instant search design is inspired by Google.

\section{Design and Architecture}
Our first thought was to store every suffix of the sentences in the corpus to the suffix trie because we do not have query log history, the entire corpus would be a good source for us to give suggestion. But storing the entire corpus not only runs longer to index and load but also uses a lot more memory. After some experimentation, we decided to separate the suggestion into three parts - unigram suggestion, n-gram suggestion and suggestion based on user log \cite{sigir}.

The first part is unigram suggestion. When the user types some prefix word, the search engine will suggest words that share the same prefix that are ranked by the frequency of the word appears in the corpus. We decided to do this because the more frequent the word, the more likely the user will want to start to  search with the word.

The second part is n-gram suggestion. In order to reduce the size of the suggestion data structure, we decided not to use suffix trie\cite{intro}. Alternatively, we treat each word as a smallest unit in the data structure, i.e., representing each word with a number. So a sentence will become a short sequence of numbers instead of a long sequence of letters and spaces. These sequence can be put into the suffix tree. But putting all suffix numbers of a sentence is not efficient enough, so instead of putting every suffix, we set a maximum length of the suffix to 3, simply because setting it to 2 wonÕt work well and setting it to 4 is not feasible for us. Finally we reduced the size of the tree by deleteing branches that are not frequent (100 times for single word, 10 tims for bi-gram and 5 times for tri-gram)

The thrid part is user logged suggestion. It is similiar to the first part except that it stores the all user logged queries into Trie instead of only a single word from the dictionary.

\section{Implementation Details}
\subsection{Details of each individual components, e.g., algorithms, APIs, etc.}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item single word
  \begin{itemize}
  \item  Indexing: store every word from the data set in a single Trie with their frequencies.
  \item Suggesting: return all words that the prefix match the query along with the frequencies. 
  \item Ranking: return the words with top 10 frequencies.
\end{itemize}
	
	
  \item multiple words
  
  \begin{itemize} 
	\item Indexing: store uni-gram, bi-gram, and tri-gram of all adjacent words from the data set into a suffix tree.
	\item Suggestion: return all N-grams that the prefix match the query along with frequencies.
	\item Ranking return the N-grams with top 10 frequencies.
\end{itemize}
  \item logged query
  \begin{itemize} 

\item Indexing: store the whole query issued by the user including the space in a trie along with their frequencies.
\item Suggesting: return all queries that the prefix match the query along with their frequencies.
\item Ranking: return the queries with the top 10 frequencies.
\end{itemize}

\item

Merge the suggestions from the above three components and return 10 results to front end.

\item

Front end put an event listener on the input box, and request suggestions whenever the event is triggered (e.g. user stops typing), then the page instantly load the results of the most likely query.

%readme should be copied from here
\begin{comment}
Step  1: unzip source.zip
Step  2: cd source
Step  3: Then compile code
	javac -cp lib/jsoup-1.8.1.jar src/edu/nyu/cs/cs2580/*.java
Step  4: Build index before running the server
	java -cp src:lib/jsoup-1.8.1.jar -Xmx4G edu.nyu.cs.cs2580.SearchEngine --mode=index --options=conf/engine.conf
Step  5: To start to server listening at port 25813
	java -cp src:lib/jsoup-1.8.1.jar -Xmx4G  edu.nyu.cs.cs2580.SearchEngine --mode=serve --options=conf/engine.conf --port=25813
Step 6: Alternatively, step 3 through 5 can be combined using a single command
	./run.sh or sh run.sh
Step 7: Open web/home.html to start enjoying our search engine

\section{Evaluation}

In this section, we evaluate our query suggestion algorithms. The goal of our project is to approximate the query suggestions based on query logs using information from corpus. Therefore, we compare the results of our algorithm to the suggestions from the commercial web search engine. More specifically, we compare our result to the results from Google. 

We examined the quality of completion in the following cases:
\begin{itemize}
\item The first case is when the first three characters of words are typed. Our search engine suggest single words in this case.
\item The second case is when one or two words are typed. Our search engine suggests phrases based on the words entered.
\end{itemize}
In both cases, we compared the results with Google suggestions. More specifically, we took top $4$ suggestions from both our search engine and Google and see if those suggestions agree. In order to avoid unnecessary personalization, we conducted the experiment after logging out from Google account. Also, our search engine can suggest previously searched queries, but we turned off this functionality.

\label{fig:word}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:word} shows the suggestions for two example prefixes (`alg-' and `pra-'). `alg-' achieved the accuracy of $0.5$, and different suggestions are also similar (`algebraic' and `algebra'). On the other hand, our system suggestions for `pra-' are too general and differ a lot from Google's results. This stems from the fact that our suggestions are based purely on frequencies in Wikipedia corpus and not on query logs. Thus it can suggest words that appears frequently in English texts but are not searched by users.

\begin{figure}[!h]

\begin{tabular}{| l | l | l | l |}

\hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}
\caption{Results of phrase suggestions. Bold red suggestions are the ones that show up both in our search engine and in Google.}
\label{fig:phrase}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:phrase} shows the results for phrase suggestions. First of all, most of the suggested phrases in the experiment make sense, although there are some phrases that do not make sense (`michigan minnesota mississippi', which came from the list of states). Among the words we experimented, `political' achieved $0.5$ accuracy (`political parties' and `political science' agreed). Accuracy for `new' was $0.25$, and disagreement stems from the fact that Google uses location information (we searched from NYU and got `new jersey transit'). 

Finally, there is an interesting difference in the suggestions for `michigan'. Our search engine suggested press and university, although Google suggested phrases related to football. This is because Google uses query logs to improve the suggestions. Most of American people are interested college football for Michigan rather than press or university itself, and this interest is reflected on the suggestions by Google.
